What is an Access Point (AP)?

	- A Wifi Access Point or just AP is a device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

Why do we need AP's in Wi-Fi networking?

	- AP's extend Wi-Fi coverage , provide better connnectivity and allow multiple devices to communicate wirelessly.

How does AP work?

	- AP connects to a wired router or a switch
	- It broadcasts Wi-Fi signals to all nearby devices.
	- Devices can connect to the AP and receive an IP address from the router.
	- Then they can communicate and access the network normally like in a wired connection.

Conclusion

	- Thus, an AP is a device that enhances network coverage , enabling seamless connectivity
