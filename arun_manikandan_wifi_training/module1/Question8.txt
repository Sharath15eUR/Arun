Objective -> To differentiate IEEE and WFA

What is IEEE?

	- IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electonics Engineers.
	- They are the ones who defines the Wi-Fi Standards.

What is WFA?

	- WFA stands for Wi-Fi Alliance.
	- They are the ones who certifices Wi-Fi products.

Why IEEE?

	- IEEE creates the technical specifications that the Wi-Fi has to follow.

Why WFA?

	- WFA ensures the interoperablity of the Wi-Fi products that hit the market.

How they work?

	- IEEE defines protocols/standards like 802.11ax and others.
	- WFA tests and certifies the devices.

Conclusion

	- IEEE is responsible to set the rules (Standards and Protocols) for Wi-Fi where as WFA ensures the devices follow these set rules.
