Objective -> To differentiate Bridge Mode and Repeater Mode in networking

What is Bridge Mode?

	- A Bridge Mode is where in we connect two seperate networks while maintaining the unique IP address ranges.

What is Repeater Mode?

	- A Repeater Mode is where we extend the existing Wi-Fi network without changing the IP structure.

When to use?

	- Use Bridge Mode when there is a need to interconnect two networks.
	- Use Repeater Mode when there is a need to boost weak signals.

How they work?

	- Bridge Mode -> It disables it's routing functions and Wi-Fi broadcast and instead connects two sperate networks together.
	- Repeater Mode -> It takes the weak incomming signal and boosts the same as the output.

Conclusion

	- Thus use Bridge Mode when there is a need for Network interconnection and Repeater Mode for boosting weak Wi-Fi signals.
