Objective -> To configure our modem/hotspot to operate only in 2.4GHz and connect to laptop and analyze and understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi

Configuring Mobile Hotspot:

	- In the mobile device go to the Network and Connectivity setting or the Wireless setting categories in settings.
	- Choose the Mobile Hotspot setting in the same
	- Now setup a name for the hotspot along with its security type (WPA/WPA2) along with password.
	- Now choose the band that we want to use ie, 2.4GHz or 5GHz.
	- Once done click on save changes and enable the same.
	- Now from the computer turn on Wi-Fi and check for the setup Hotspot Name.
	- Enter the password and check connectivity.

What is 2.4GHz?

	- 2.4GHz refers to the lower frequency band that Wi-Fi uses for longer range, more interference and lower speeds.

What is 5GHz?

	- 5GHz refers to the higher frequency band that Wi-Fi uses for shroter range, less interference and faster speeeds.

How they work?

	- 2.4GHz penetrates wall better, making it better for larger areas.

	- 5GHz offers higher sppeed but ultimately struggles with obstacle penetration.

When to use which?

	- Use 2.4GHz when longer coverage is required and speed is not a concern.
	- Use 5GHz when higher speeds are required and coverage is not a concern.

Conclusion

	- Use 2.4GHz for coverage and 5GHz for higher speeds.
