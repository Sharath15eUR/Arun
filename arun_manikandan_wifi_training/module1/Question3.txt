Objective -> To understand BSS and ESS

What is BSS?

	- BSS (Basic Service Set) -> A single Access Point (AP) and it's connected devices for a BSS

What is ESS? 
	- ESS (Extended Service Set) -> Multiple AP's connected to the same network form an ESS, this allows for roaming services


Why BSS and ESS?

	- BSS is primarily used for small and single AP networks
	- ESS provides a larger coverage and is mostly used in enterprises and public networks
	- ESS is acheived by setting a common SSID to multiple AP's enabling devices to switch between them without disconnecting.

Conclusion

	- Both BSS and ESS are essential in Wi-Fi networking.
	- BSS is used when the network needed is small and ESS is ideal when the network needed is large.
