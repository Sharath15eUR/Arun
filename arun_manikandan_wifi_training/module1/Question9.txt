Objective -> To explore different Wi-Fi backhaul types.

Types of Wi-Fi Internet Connectivity Backhaul:

    1. Fiber Optic: - Uses light pulses through glass fibers for high-speed data transmission.
       	- Offers the highest bandwidth and lowest latency.
        - Commonly used for residential and commercial connections.

    2. Cable Broadband:
        - Uses coaxial cables to transmit data.
       	- Offers good bandwidth and reliability.
        - Common in urban areas.

    3. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):
        - Uses existing telephone lines for data transmission.
        - Slower speeds compared to fiber or cable.
        - Common in areas with established telephone infrastructure.

    4. Wireless Broadband (Fixed Wireless Access - FWA): - Uses radio waves to transmit data between a base station and a customer's antenna.
        - Useful in areas where wired infrastructure is limited.
        - Can be affected by weather conditions.

    4. Satellite Internet:
        - Uses satellites to transmit data.
        - Available in remote areas.
        - Higher latency and lower speeds compared to other options.

Why different backhauls?

	- Each backhaul has different speed, latency, and cost factors.

How it works:

	- The backhaul connects Wi-Fi routers to the main internet provider.

Home network backhaul and properties:

	- Backhaul type : Fiber Optic
	- Provider		: ACT
	
	- Backhaul Properties :

		- Technology : GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network)
		- Bandwidth  : Upto 1 Gbps
		- Latency	 : Low (Mostly around and below 10ms)
		- Reliablity : High

Conclusion

	- The speed , cost and availablity are some of the main factors that need to be kept in mind before choosing the right backhaul for the network.
