Objective -> To understand how data rate is calculated

What is data rate?

	- Data rate refers to the speed at which data is transferred over a network.

	- It is usually expressed in btis per second (bps) megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps).

How to calculate:

	- Data rate is calculated using the below formula:

		Data Rate = Modulation Rate × Channel Bandwidth × Number of Spatial Streams

Conclusion:

	- The data rate is determined by several key factors including modulation scheme channel width spatial streams and coding rate.
