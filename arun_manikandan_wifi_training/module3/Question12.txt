Objective -> To understand how data rate is calculated

What is data rate? 

	- Data rate refers to the speed at which data is transferred over a network.

	- It is usually expressed in btis per second (bps) megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps).

How to calculate:

	- Data rate is calculated using the below formula:

		Data Rate = (Bits per Symbol) × (Symbol Rate) × (Number of Spatial Streams) × (Coding Rate)
	Where:

		*Bits per Symbol (Modulation Order): The number of bits encoded in each transmitted symbol (e.g., QPSK = 2, 16-QAM = 4, 64-QAM = 6, 256-QAM = 8, 1024-QAM = 10).
		
		*Symbol Rate: The number of symbols transmitted per second, related to the channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing (in OFDM/OFDMA).
		
		*Number of Spatial Streams: The number of independent data streams transmitted simultaneously using MIMO.   
		
		*Coding Rate: The efficiency of the Forward Error Correction (FEC) code (e.g., 1/2, 2/3, 3/4).

Conclusion:

	- The data rate is determined by several key factors including modulation scheme channel width spatial streams and coding rate.
