Objective -> To understand PPDU PLCP and PMD

What are PPDU PCLP and PMD:

	PPDU (Physical Layer Protocol Data Unit)

		- PPDU is the unit of transmission at the physical layer in Wi-Fi networks.

		- It consists of both control and data info that is transmitted from transmitter to the receiver.

	PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol)

		- PLCP is a sublayer withing the PHY layer that is responsible for converting higher-layer data into format that can be transmitted at PPDU

		- It adds a header to the data preparing it for the acutal transmission.

	PMD (Physical Medium Dependent)

		- PMD is asublayer that handles the actual transmission and reception of the data on the physical medium.

		- It defines the modulation coding and how the data is tranmistted on the medium.

Importance:

	- PPDU ensures that data is transmitted in a standard structured format.

	- PLCP helps in organizing and preparing data from higher layers for transmission.

	- PMD manages how signals are actualyl encoded and transmitted over the air.

Working:

	* PPDU Structure:
	
	   - The PPDU is the entire data transmission unit in the PHY layer.
	
	   - It consists of:
	
	        PLCP Header: Information about the transmitted data.
	
	        Payload (Data): The actual data being sent.
	
	        Tail (Optional): Used for padding to ensure proper transmission alignment.
	
	* PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) – What does it do?
	
	   - Prepares the data for transmission. The PLCP header encapsulates the higher-layer data and provides necessary control info such as:
	
	        Data rate
	
	        Signal information
	
	        Length of the data being transmitted
	
	   - Converts the data into a PPDU that the PMD can process.
	
	* PMD (Physical Medium Dependent) – What does it do?
	
	   - The PMD sub-layer handles the modulation and encoding of the data for transmission:
	
	        It modulates the signal (e.g., OFDM, DSSS).
	
	        It adds error correction codes to ensure reliable transmission.
	
	        It transmits data using radio waves via the physical medium (wireless spectrum).

Problems that can be faced:

	- Both PLCP and PMD add extra data which could reduce the overall efficiency.

	- Synchronization between the PLCP and PMD is crucial if not transmission error occurs.

Conclusion:

	- PPDU is the data transmission unit at the PHY layer PLCP converts higher-layer data into a transmittable format and PMD handles the modulation and transmission using the physical medium.
