Objective -> To differentiate and understand DSSS and FHSSS

What are DSSS and FHSS:

	- DSSS stands for Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum

	- FHSS stands for Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum

	- Both are spread spectrum modulation techniques that are used in wireless communication and in standards like 802.11b (DHSS) and 802.11(FHSS)

	- At its core they both spread the signal over a wide frequency band making it resistant to interference and jamming.

Why DSSS and FHSS

	- Minimizes interference from companion devices.

	- Increases security.

	- Improves reliability in noisy environments.

How do they work?

	DSSS:

		- Each bit of the data is multiplied by a high-frequency pseudorandom noise (PN) code./

		- Data -> PN Code -> Spread Signal

		- This increases bandwidth and the signal becomes more resilient.

		- At the receiver side the same PN code is used to un spread the signal and retrieve the data.

	FHSS:

		- The signal hops between different frequencies based on a predefined hopping sequence.

		- Sender and receiver first synchorinize on the same hopping pattern (Important).

		- Transmission occurs as burst (a number of signals are sent as batch) over different frequencies.

		- If one of the frequency is noisy then it hops to anaother.

Problems that can be faced:

	DSSS:

		- If sender and receiver are not synchronized can lead to loss of data.
		- Uses more bandwidth.

	FHSS:

		- Lower data rate
		- Synchronization delay can lead to loss of data.

Conclusion:

	- DSSS And FHSS provide secure and reliable wireless communication techniques.
