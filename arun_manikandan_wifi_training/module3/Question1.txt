Objective -> To understand different 802.11 PHY layer standards

What and different 802.11 PHY Layer Standards :

	- The 802.11 PHY layer standards are the ones those define how data is physically transmitted over a wireless network.

	- Tehy are all the part of IEEE 802.11 family.

	Standards:

		* 802.11a
		* 802.11b
		* 802.11g
		* 802.11g
		* 802.11n
		* 802.11ac
		* 802.11ax
		* 802.11be (Not released yet Wi-Fi 7)

Why various PHY Standards?

	- Speed 

	- Frequency Bands

	- Signal Quality 

	- Energy Efficieny

	- The above are some of the factors that keep evolving thus keeping Wi-Fi updated for HD video to enterprise level usages.

How it works?

	- The PHY layer works alongside closely witht he MAC layer but majorily focuses purely on raido signal transmission and reception.

	- For each standard either one of the following are modified

		* Modulation Techniques (DSSS , OFDM , OFDMA).
		* Channel Bandwidth (20MHz , 40MHz , 160MHz).
		* MIMO (Multiple Input , Multuiple Output) for 802.11n and above only.
		* Maximum data rate (based on how fast and data needs to be encoded and sent per second)

Common Problems faced:

	* Interference between 2.4GHz bands
	* Lower range for higher frequency bands
	* More devices connected leads to slower speeds comapratively

Conclusion:

	- The 802.11 PHY standards evolve to provide better and faster speeds along with efficieny and energy control and support for more devices
