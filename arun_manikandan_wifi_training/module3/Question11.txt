Objective -> To list and understand the different types of PPDU

What are the types of PPDU:

	- PPDU represents the unit of transmission.

	- It includes both control and data infromation in a structured format.

	- Mainly three types:

		* Data PPDU -> used to carry actual data from higher layers.
		* Control PPDU -> Used for control frames
		* Management PPDU -> Used for management frames

Importance:

	- PPDU formats define how data is transferred from one device to another.

	- Different generations of Wi-Fi uses different modulations and tansmission techniques to increase throughput and ensure reliable communciation.

How it works accross generations:	

	* Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n)
	
	    Modulation: OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
	
	    PPDU Structure:
	
	        Preamble
	
	        PLCP Header (Contains data rate frame length etc.)
	
	        MAC Header (Contains address/control info)
	
	        Data (Payload)
	
	        Tail (Padding for alignment)
	
	    Key Feature: MIMO for multiple spatial streams higher throughput
	
	Wi-Fi 4 PPDU Example:

		| Preamble | PLCP Header | MAC Header | Data | Tail |

	* Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)
	
	    Modulation: 256-QAM, supporting wider channels (up to 160 MHz)
	
	    PPDU Structure:
	
	        Short Preamble
	
	        PLCP Header
	
	        MAC Header
	
	        Data
	
	        Tail
	
	    Key Feature: MU-MIMO for simultaneous communication with multiple devices
	
	Wi-Fi 5 PPDU Example:

		| Short Preamble | PLCP Header | MAC Header | Data | Tail |

	* Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)
	
	    Modulation: 1024-QAM (higher-order modulation)
	
	    PPDU Structure:
	
	        Preamble
	
	        PLCP Header
	
	        MAC Header
	
	        Data
	
	        Tail
	
	    Key Features:
	
	        OFDMA for multiple users sharing the same channel
	
	        Target Wake Time (TWT) for power efficiency
	
	Wi-Fi 6 PPDU Example:

		| Preamble | PLCP Header | MAC Header | Data | Tail |

	* Wi-Fi 6E (Extended)
	
	    Modulation: Same as Wi-Fi 6 but includes the 6 GHz band
	
	    PPDU Structure: Same as Wi-Fi 6 but with 6 GHz frequency band
	
	    Key Feature: Addition of the 6 GHz band for more spectrum reduced interference
	
	Wi-Fi 6E PPDU Example:

		| Preamble | PLCP Header | MAC Header | Data | Tail |

Problems that can be faced:

	- In crowded environments high density netowrks face intereference.

	- Newer Wi-Fi standards are not backward compatible with devices

Conclusion:

	- The PPDU is a crucial unit for transmitting data across the PHY layer.

	- Over generations PPDU has adapted to support higher data rates and better spectrum utilization.
