Objective -> To understand the significance of OFDM and its performance perks

What is OFDM?

	- OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) is a digital multi-carrier modulation technique.

	- Mainly used in 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax

	- Instead of sending one high-speed stream OFDM splits the signal into multiple slower sub-signals transmitted simultaneously on orthogonal subcarriers.

Why OFDM?

	 - Unlike DSSS which has issues like multiplath interference , limited bandwidth usage and others OFDM solves them.

	 - OFDM solves these by being resistant to interference and multipath and making efficient use of the spectrum allowing higher data rates.

How OFDM works?

	- The available channel is divided into many subcarriers

	- Each of these subcarriers are spaced orthogonally leading to no interference amongst them.

	- The data is split into chunks and each chunk is modulated using BPSK/QPS/QAM and are sent on a different subcarrier.

	- They are transmitted simultaneously making it more efficient.

	- Uses Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT) at the trasmitter so that teh data is in time-domain signals.

	- At receiver side FFT(Fast Fourier Transformation) is used to recover the signal and decode the data.

	- A part of the signal is copied and added to the beginning of each symbol.

	- This prevents multipath delay.

Benefits of OFDM in WLAN:

	- Multipath resistance.

	- High data rates.

	- Spectral efficiency.

	- Scalability.

Conclusion:

	- OFDM boosts speed by transmitting in parallel.

	- Resilient againt interference.
