Objective -> To understand how frequency bands are divided

What are frequency bands?

	- Wi-Fi being operated on radio waves are grouped into bands.

	- Each band having specific frequencies and are further divide into channels.

	Common bands:

		* 2.4 GHz
		* 5 GHz
		* 6 GHz

	- Each band consists of multiple channels, which are narrow frequency ranges.

Why is dividing bands important?

	- Lower frequencies travel long distances.

	- Higher frequencies support higher bandwidht.

	- Some bands are more crowded.

How it works?

	* 2.4 GHz Band
	
	    Frequency Range: 2.400 – 2.4835 GHz
	
	    Typical Channel Width: 20 MHz
	
	    Total Channels: 14
	
	    Non-overlapping Channels: 1, 6, and 11 — all others overlap and cause interference
	
	    Used in Standards: 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n
	
	    Channel Center Frequencies:
	
	        Channel 1: 2.412 GHz
	
	        Channel 6: 2.437 GHz
	
	        Channel 11: 2.462 GHz
	
	    Issue: Very crowded — commonly interfered by Bluetooth, microwaves, baby monitors, etc.

	* 5 GHz Band
	
	    Frequency Range: 5.150 – 5.825 GHz
	
	    Supported Channel Widths: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz
	
	    Channels Available: Ranges from 36 to 165 (depends on region)
	
	    Non-overlapping: Even at 20 MHz, channels are cleanly spaced
	
	    Used in Standards: 802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax
	
	    Channel Groups and Use:
	
	        Channels 36–64: UNII-1 and UNII-2A — Indoor use
	
	        Channels 100–144: UNII-2C — DFS channels; may temporarily disconnect if radar is detected
	
	        Channels 149–165: UNII-3 — Outdoor use
	
	    Note: DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) avoids radar interference by switching channels automatically

	* 6 GHz Band (Wi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7 only)
	
	    Frequency Range: 5.925 – 7.125 GHz
	
	    Supported Channel Widths: 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz, and up to 320 MHz
	
	    Total Channels: 59 new 20 MHz channels
	
	    Used in Standards: 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6E) and 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)
	
	    Channel Range: Channels 1 to 233 support wide bandwidth options
	
	    Advantage: Extremely clean spectrum — little to no interference. Ideal for high-bandwidth applications like VR, AR, and 8K streaming.

Problems that can be faced:

	- 2.4 GHz has interference problem meaning mode devices leads to congestion.

	- 5GHz and 6GHz signals weaken faster.

	- Only newer devices are capable of using 5/66 GHz.

Conclusion:

	- Thus each band has their own advantages and disadvantages.

	- Further dividing these bands we ensure we avoid intereference and enable more users.
