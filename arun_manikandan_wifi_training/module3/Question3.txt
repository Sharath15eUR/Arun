Objective -> To understand modulation schemes working in PHY layer and compare the same along with performances over different Wi-Fi standards.

What are modulation schemes?

	- Modulation is the process of encoding binary data into a carrier signal(sine wavce) so that it can be transmitted over the air.

	- In PHY layer they essentialy determine how data is represented over the radio signal, how fast data is sent.

	- Common Modulation Schemes include:

		* BPSK -> Binary Phase Shift Keying
		* QPSK -> Quadrature Phase Shift Keying
		* QAM -> Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM , 64-QAM , etc)

Why are they important?

	- Higher modulation means more bits transmitted.

	- Some schemes provide more resistance to noise.

	- Lower modulations have better range coverage.

	- In noisy environments simpler modulations often perfrom better.

How it works?

	- A carrier wave is modiffied based on the data bits.

	- Wi-Fi mainly uses phase and amplitude based waves to carry data

	Example:

		BPSK -> Two phases 0 or 180
		QPSK -> Four phases (Twice as BPSK)
		16-QAM -> Combines amplitude + phase

Comparison:

	* 802.11b
	
	    Modulation: CCK / DSSS
	
	    Improvement: Introduced digital modulation over analog; basic but reliable.

	* 802.11a/g
	
	    Modulation: 64-QAM
	
	    Improvement: Jumped to OFDM with higher-order modulation enabling much faster speeds (up to 54 Mbps) compared to 11b.

	* 802.11n
	
	    Modulation: 64-QAM (same as 11a/g)
	
	    Improvement: Not from modulation itself but from combining it with MIMO—boosted data rates using multiple streams.

	* 802.11ac
	
	    Modulation: 256-QAM
	
	    Improvement: Higher symbol density—more bits per symbol than 64-QAM (8 vs. 6), giving significantly higher throughput over the same bandwidth.

	* 802.11ax
	
	    Modulation: 1024-QAM
	
	    Improvement: Even denser modulation—10 bits per symbol, increasing efficiency and capacity, especially in crowded environments.

	* 802.11be
	
	    Modulation: 4096-QAM (planned)
	
	    Improvement: Pushes the modulation further to 12 bits per symbol, enabling extremely high data rates for next-gen applications.

Problems that can be faced:

	- Higher modulations like 256-QAM and others are very sensitive to noises.

	- Higher modulations work only for shorter distances.

	- Older devices cant decode newer modulation techniques.

Conclusion:

	- Modulation schemes define how the binary data become radio waves.

	- As Wi-Fi evolves even more complex modulation techniques are employed for faster data transmission.

	- High Modulation means more speed but low range.
	
	- Low Modulation means lower speed but high reliability.
