Objective -> TO understand the role of Guard Intervals in WLAN and how it improves efficiency

What is Guard Interval?

	- A Guard Interval is a short time gap inserted between transmitted symbols in WLAN.

	- It is done so to prevent inter-symbol intereference which occurs when signals from previos transmissions overlap the current one.

Why is it important?

	- Wi-Fi signals often bounce off surfaces

	- Without guard interval there would be interference between symbols

	- GI ensures that each symbol has a clean window.

How does it work?

	- Transmitter sends a symbol.

	- Then adds a cyclic prefix (copy of end symbol) to act as GI.

	- Receiver wiats during GI and then captures the clean signal.

	- It uuses the cyclic prefix to sync timing and channel.

	- 800ns is the default Guard Interval for most devices.

How it improves Efficiency?

	- Lower GI means less wait time between symbols which means higher data throughput.

	- Shorter GI's typically tend to be more efficient in data transfers.

Problems taht can be faced:

	- Shorter GIs can increase decoding errors if echoses are there.

	- Some older devices may not support short GI modes.

Conclusions

	- GI are crucial to enusre clean and reliable transmission in wireless networks

	- Normal GI is 800ns which is safe in noisy environments.

	- Short GI is 400ns boosts speeds and efficiiency but is prone ot erros.
