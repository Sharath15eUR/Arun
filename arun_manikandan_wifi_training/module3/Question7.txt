Objective -> To understand the structure of 802.11 PHY frame and its key components.

What is 802.11 PHY Layer frame:

	- The PHY layer frame (Physical Protocol Data Unit - PPDU) is the lowest layers of a Wi-Fi frame that gets modulated and trasmitted.

	- It enacpsulates:

		* Preamble (For sync)
		* Header (transmission info)
		* Payload (actual MAC Frame data)

Importance:

	- It allows devices to synchronize understand modulation and decode the incomming frame.

	- Without proper PHY Wi-Fi receivers wouldnt know how to interpret the data.

General Structure:

	Preamble | PHY Header | PSDU (Payload)

	1. Preamble:

		- Used for timing synchronization channel estimation adn indentifying the PHY version.

		- Short Training Field (STF) used for signal detection and automatic gain control.

		- Long Training Field (LTF) used for channel estimation.

		- Singal Field (SIG) contains modulation and coding with length.

	2. PHY Header:

		- Provides meta-info about the transmission itslef.

		- It mainly includes:

			* Data rate
			* Frame lenght
			* Coding rate
			* Guard Interval Inforamtion
			* MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) Index

	3. PSDU (PLCP Service Data Unit):

		- Contains the actual data from the MAC layer

		- Contains:

			 * MAC Header
			 * Logical Link Control (LIC)
			 * IP/TCP/UDP packets
			 * QoS and Encryption

		- This portion is apssed down from teh MAC and gets modulated using the shceme specified in the header.

	PLCP:

		- Stands for Physical Layer Convergence Protocol.

		- Responsible for the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mode and building packets for different physical layer technologies.

Problems faced:

	- Weak signal or noise can prevent synchronization.

	- Receiver may fail to decode data.

	- Frames might clash if preamble isnt decoded early.

Conclusion:

	- The 802.11 PHY Frame is responsible for synchronizing transmission instruction of hwo to decode and delivering the data itslef.
