Objective -> Differentiate between OFDM and OFDMA

What is OFDM and OFDMA?

	- OFDM stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing

	- OFDMA stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access

	- OFDM is a method of transmitting data by splitting into multiple narrow band channels and sendiing in parallel.

	- OFDMA is an extension of OFDM that allows multiple users to transmit and recieve data simultaneously using different subset of subcarriers.

Importance:

	- They help in improving the efficieincy reducing interference and help in acheiveing higher data rates.

	- OFDMA brings in multi-user access (Wi-Fi 6 uses OFDMA) making it more efficient in crowded networks and better than OFDM.

Hopw they work

	* OFDM:
	
	    - Takes a high-rate data stream and splits it into multiple slower sub-streams.
	
	    - Each sub-stream is transmitted on its own subcarrier orthogonal to others (so they don’t interfere).
	
	    - Subcarriers are spaced closely to maximize spectral efficiency.

	* OFDMA:
	
	    - Works like OFDM but smarter.
	
	    - Instead of using all subcarriers for one user OFDMA divides them into Resource Units (RUs).
	
	    - Each user gets a subset of subcarriers → multiple users can transmit at the same time on the same channel.

OFDM VS OFMDA:

	* User per transmission:
	
	    OFDM: 1 user at a time
	
	    OFDMA: Multiple users at once
	
	* Subcarrier usage:
	
	    OFDM: All subcarriers assigned to one user
	
	    OFDMA: Subcarriers split into Resource Units (RUs)
	
	* Latency:
	
	    OFDM: Higher
	
	    OFDMA: Lower
	
	* Efficiency:
	
	    OFDM: Lower in dense networks
	
	    OFDMA: Much higher in dense networks
	
	* Use case:
	
	    OFDM: Good for high-throughput scenarios
	
	    OFDMA: Great for mixed traffic (IoT, voice, video)
	
	* Uplink multi-user support:
	
	    OFDM: Not supported
	
	    OFDMA: Supported (multi-user uplink)

Problems that can be faced:

	- OFDMA requires smarter scheduling and synchronization.

	- Older devices cannot use OFDMA

Conclusion:

	- OFDM is fast reliable for one user at a time.

	- OFDMA ont eh other hand is smarter more efficient and ideal for multi-user applications.
