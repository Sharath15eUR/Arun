Objective -> To understand how a station connects to an AP using association process

What is Client Association?

	- Association is the process by which a wireless client establishes a logical connection with an AP.

	- This allows it to send and receive data on the network.

Steps:

	- Scanning (Discovery Phase);
	
		* The clinet scans for Aps using either Active or Passive Scanning.

	- Authentication:

		* A basic security handshake to verify identity.

	- Association Request:

		* Client sends Association Request frame to the AP.
		* It includes SSID supported rates and power management settings.

	- Association Response:

		* The AP replies with an Association Repsonse frame
		* It contains status code and Association ID

	- 4 Way Handshake (if WPA2/WPA3):

		* For secure networks , a 4 way handshake follows to exchange encryption keys

Conclusion:

	- The client association process is essential for joining a Wi-Fi network.

	- It involves scannign , authentication and association.
