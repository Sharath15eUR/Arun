Objective -> TO understand how wireless devices scan and discover Wi-Fi Networks

What is Scanning?

	- Scanning is the process through which a wiress devices (Station) searches for available wireless netowrks (APs) before associating with them.

Why?

	- To discover nearby Wi-Fi networks.

	- To identify signal strength and others.

	- To support roaming by scanning and switching to better AP.

	- To establish initial connection or reconnect to a network.

Types of Scanning:

	1. Passive Scanning:

		* Working:

			- The station listens on each channel for Beacon frames sent by APs.
			- It does not transmit any probe requests.

		* Steps:

			- Station tunes into a channel.
			- Waits for Beacon Frame.
			- Extracts SSID and other informations.
			- Moves to next channel and repeats

		* Advantages:

			- Energy Efficient.
			- Stealthy.

		* Disadvantages:

			- Slower since it depends on beacon interval.
			- May miss APs that are not broadcasting beacons.

	2. Active Scanning:

		* Working:

			- The station sends Probe Request on each channel.
			- Nearby APs respond with a Probe Response.

		* Steps:

			- Station sends a Probe Request on a specific channel.
			- APs receiving the request respond with a Probe Response.
			- Station gathers information from responses and decides an AP.
			- Switches to the next channel and repeats.

		* Advantages:

			- Faster AP discovery.
			- Useful for hidden SSID.

		* Disadvantages:

			- Consumes more power.
			- can be detected.
			- Channel Congestion.

Challenges:

	- Active scanning on congested channles may lead to interference.

	- Passive scanning may miss APs due to beacon loss or long intervals.

	- Active scanning may cause latency spikes during real-time.

Conclusion:

	- 802.11 scannign process is essential for entowork discovery and roaming.

	- Passive scanning is quiet and power efficient.

	- Active scanning is faster and more aggressive.
