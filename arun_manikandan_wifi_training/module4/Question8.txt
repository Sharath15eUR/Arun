Objective -> To understand the different methodologies used by the MAC layer

What is Medium Access Control (MAC)?

	- MAC is a sublayer of the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) in the OSI model.
	
	- It regulates access to the shared physical medium, ensuring multiple devices can communicate efficiently and fairly without causing collisions.

Why Medium Access Control is Needed?

	- In shared networks (wired or wireless) multiple devices want to transmit data at the same time.
	
	- If devices transmit simultaneously collisions occur leading to data loss and retransmisssions.
	
	- MAC methods coordinate transmissions prevent collisions, maximize throughout and ensure fairness.

How MAC Methodologies Work:

   -  MAC defines rules and mechanisms that decide:

        * When a device can transmit.

        * How collisions are handled if they occur.

        * How the medium is shared among devices.

Types:

	1. Contention-Based Methodologies (Random Access):
	
	    - Devices compete for the medium.
	
	    - Collisions can happen, recovery methods are used.
	
		Techniques:
		
		1. ALOHA:
		
		    - Devices transmit whenever they have data, without checking the medium.
		    - Very simple but high collision probability.
		    - Used in early wireless networks.
		
		2. Slotted ALOHA:
		
		    - Time is divided into slots, and transmissions happen only at slot beginnings.
		    - Reduces collisions.
		    - Requires synchronization.
		
		3. Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA):
		
		    - Devices sense the medium before transmitting.
		    - If the medium is busy, they wait.
		    - Reduces collisions compared to ALOHA.
		
		4. CSMA/CD (Collision Detection):
		
		    - Used in wired Ethernet (IEEE 802.3).
		    - Devices detect collisions during transmission and back off before retrying.
		    - Cannot be used in wireless networks.
		
		5. CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance):
		
		    - Used in Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11).
		    - Devices avoid collisions using random backoff timers and RTS/CTS mechanism.
		    - Necessary in wireless networks where collision detection is difficult.

	2. Controlled Access Methodologies (Deterministic Access):
	
	    - Access is organized, collisions are avoided.
	
		Techniques:
		
		1. Polling:
		
		    - A central controller (like AP) polls each device asking if it has data to send.
		    - Efficient under high load.
		    - Adds overhead under low load.
		
		2. Token Passing:
		
		    - A special token circulates among devices.
		    - Only the device with the token can transmit.
		    - No collisions, used in Token Ring networks.
		
		3. Scheduling:
		
		    - Medium access is scheduled using predefined rules like TDMA.
		    - Guarantees access.
		    - Used in LTE and 5G networks.
		    
	3. Channelization-Based Methodologies (Sharing the Medium):
	
	    - Bandwidth is divided into separate channels to allow simultaneous transmissions.
	
		Techniques:
		
		1. Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA):
		
		    - Different users transmit over different frequency bands.
		    - Used in 1G systems.
		    - Low spectral efficiency.
		
		2. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA):
		
		    - Users transmit in different time slots.
		    - Used in GSM networks.
		    - Needs tight synchronization.
		
		3. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA):
		
		    - All users transmit over the same frequency using unique codes.
		    - Used in 3G networks.
		    - High resistance to interference.
		
		4. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA):
		
		    - Bandwidth is divided into multiple orthogonal subcarriers.
		    - Used in 4G LTE and Wi-Fi 6.
		    - Highly efficient and flexible.
Conclusion:

    - MAC methodologies are critical for efficient and fair communication over shared media.

    - Depending on network type (wired, wireless, cellular), techniques like CSMA/CA, Polling, TDMA, or OFDMA are used.
