Objective -> To understand the significance of MAC and its position in the OSI model

What is MAC?

	- MAC stands for Media Access Control and is a sublayer of the Layer2 (Data Link Layer) in the OSI model.

	- It is responsible for controlling how devices on a network gain access to the medium and the permission to transmit the actual data.

Why?

	- MAC ensures efficient and collision-free data transmission.

	- Prevents data loss and corruption during transmission.

	- Capablity to identify devices uniquely based on MAC address.

	- Enables fair access to the physical medium.

Work

	- Each device has a unique MAC address burned into the NIC (Netowrk Interface Card).

	- It frames teh data received from the network layer before passing it to the physical layer.

	- Provides CSMA/CD (Ethernet) and CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi) - Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection / Collision Avoidance. 

	- Provisions Cyclic Redunancy Check (CRC) for error detection.

Why is it part of Layer 2?

	- The MAC is a subpart of the Lyaer 2 - Data Link Layer.

	- The Data Link layer itself is divided into 2 parts:

		1. LLC (Logical Link Control) -> manages communication between network layter and MAC layer.
		2. MAC (Media Access Control) -> manages access to the physical transmission medium.

Problems that can be faced:

	- Attackers can impersonate another devices MAC address.

	- MAC-based communication is not scalalbe well over large networks.

	- Can flood the network segment.

Conclusion

	- The MAC layer is crucial for ensuring orderly and efficient data transmission overa  shared medium.

	- By uniquely IDing devices and amanaging they can send data without any collisions and data loss.
