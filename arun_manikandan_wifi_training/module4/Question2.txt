Objective -> TO understand the MAC frame format in IEEE 802.11 and explain the same

What is 802.11 MAC frame?

	- The 802.11 MAC frame is a structured format used in Wi-Fi communication to transmit data wirelessly.

	- It includes control , addressing and data fields for the same.

Need

	- Unlike 802.3 (Ethernet) Wi-Fi needs more addressing flexiblity.

	- Needs additional control information for managing authentication , association etc.

	- Deal with wireless-specific issues liek interference and power saving , etc.

802.11 MAC Frame Format:

+------------+------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+------------+------------------+
| Frame Ctrl | Duration   | Address 1       | Address 2        | Address 3        | Seq Ctrl   | Address 4 (opt.) |
+------------+------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+------------+------------------+
|            Frame Body                 |        FCS (Frame Check Sequence)       |
+---------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

Purpose of each field is as follows:

	1. Frame Ctrl or Frame Control

		- Contains subfields taht define the type fo frame and control information like:

			* Protocol Version.
			* Type
			* Subtype

			and others

	2. Duration

		- Indicates the time (in milliseconds) the channel will be reserved for the frame's transmission.

		- Used for collision avoidance

	3. Address Fields:

		- Address 1 -> Receiver address (Final destination).

		- Address 2 -> Transmitter address (Sender).

		- Address 3 -> BSSID

		- Address 4 (Optional) -> Used in Wireless Distribution System when both soruce and destination are beyound AP.

	4. Sequence Control:

		- Fragment Number -> helps in assembling fragmented frames.

		- Sequence NUmber -> used to detect duplicate frames if any.

	5. Frame Body

		- Actual Data payload , can vary depending on frame type.

	6. Frame Check Sequence (FCS):

		- Provides error detection usign CRC.

		- Helps the receiver validate the integrity of the received frame.

Challenges:

	- The MAC frame includes multiple address fields leading to an overhead.

	- Wireless frames are more prone to data loss due to noise.

	- Requires complex parsing.

Conclusion:

	- 802.11 MAC header format is designed to accomodate the complex needs of Wireless communication.

	- Every field has a function and role of its own to ensure accurate delivery and device coordination in a Wi-Fi network.
