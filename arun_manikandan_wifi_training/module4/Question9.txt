Objective -> To understand what Block ACK is why it was introduced how it works and its impact on wireless communication efficiency.

What is Block ACK?

	- Block ACK (Block Acknowledgment) is an enhancement to the traditional acknowledgment (ACK) method in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi).

	- Instead of sending an ACK for every frame Block ACK allows multiple frames to be acknowledged together in a single response.

Why Block ACK?

	- In normal ACK each frame waits for an individual ACK adding overhead and delay.

	- Block ACK reduces overhead by:

	    * Grouping acknowledgments.

	    * Reducing the number of control frames.

	    * Improving overall network throughput.

WOrking:

	1. Block ACK Request (BAR):
	
	    - Sender sends a Block ACK Request after transmitting a batch of frames.
	
	    - It asks the receiver for a collective acknowledgment.
	
	2. Block ACK (BA):
	
		    - Receiver responds with a Block ACK a bitmap indicating received and missing frames.
	
	3. Retransmission:
	
	    - Sender retransmits only the missing frames not the entire batch.

Advantages:

	- Higher Throughput:
	
	    * Fewer acknowledgment frames more time for data transmission.
	
	- Lower Overhead:
	
	    * Multiple ACKs combined into one frame saving bandwidth.
	
	- Better Efficiency:
	
	    * Effective for large bursts like video streaming or file downloads.
	
	- Improved Retransmission:
	
	    * Only missing frames are retransmitted.
	
	- Crucial for Modern Wi-Fi:
	
	    * Essential for 802.11n 802.11ac and 802.11ax where frame aggregation is common.

POssible Issues:

	- Block ACK Overhead for Small Traffic:
	
	    * For small bursts Block ACK might add unnecessary complexity.
	
	- Increased Complexity:
	
	    * Implementation is more complex compared to simple ACK.
	
	- Delay in Acknowledgment:
	
	    * Slight delay before receiving the Block ACK affecting very delay-sensitive applications.

Conclusion:
	
	- Block ACK improves efficiency in wireless communications by reducing control overhead and increasing throughput.
	
	- It is a key feature in high-throughput Wi-Fi standards like 802.11n 802.11ac and 802.11ax.
