Objective -> To list and understand the different MAC layer funcionalities

What are MAC layer functionalities:

	- The MAC layer in IEEE 802.11 is responsible for managing how data is transmitted over the wireless medium.

	- It handles fucntions like frame construction , access control etc of wireless devices.

Management Plane Function:	

	- Beacon Frame Transmission -> APs send periodic beacons to advertise network presence.

	- Probe Request/Response -> Used for active scanning by stations to discover networks.

	- Authentication -> Initial security handshake between a station and an AP.

	- Association/Reassociation -> Establishes/updates connection between teh station and AP.

	- Disassociation -> Notifies that a station is leaving the netwrok.

	- Deauthentication -> Terminates the authentication state between the station and AP.

Control Plane Function:

	- Request to Send (RTS) -> Used to reserve the medium before sending frames.

	- Clear to Send (CTS) -> Sent in response to RTS to allow the sender to transmit.

	- Acknowledgement (ACK) -> Confirms the successful frame reception to avoid retransmission.

	- Carrier Sensing -> Checks if the channel is clear before transmission.

	- Fragmentation Control -> Breaks large frames intro smaller ones for reliable delivery.

	- Retransmission Control -> Retransmits frames if no ACK is received for the transmitted frame.

Data Plane Functions:

	- Data Frame Delivery -> Transfers user data from source to destination.

	- Frame Aggregation (A-MSDU , A-MPDU) -> Combines multiple frames to improve efficiency.

	- Error Detection (FCS) -> Uses CRC to detect frame errros.

	- Framentation and Reassembly -> Handles large packets in poor channel conditions.

	- QoS Control -> Prioritizes traffic based on application needs.

	- MAC Address -> Uses 48bit MAC address to uniquely ID devices.

	- Encryption control -> Works with higher layers for encrypted paylaod delivery.

Conclusion:	

	- The MAC layer in IEEE 802.11 is responsible for setting up the connection , controlling access to the medium.

	- These functions accross Management, Control, Data planes work together to deliver the data wirelessly.
