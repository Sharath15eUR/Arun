Objective -> To understand where CAPWAP fits in teh OSI model and the role of its tunnels.

What OSI layer does CAPWAP operate at?

	- CAPWAP operates at the Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and Layer 3 (Network Layer)  of the OSI model.

Why CAPWAP uses 2 tunnels?

	- Two tunnels:

		* Data Traffic
		* Control Traffic

	- Seperated control and data traffic for better efficiency and security.

	- Control tunnel ensures secure AP management.

	- Data tunnel enacpsulates client traffic reducing exposure.

How CAPWAP Tunnels work?

	- Control Tunnel (UDP 5246)

		* Securely transmits AP-WLC control messages like configurations authentication,etc.

	- Data Tunnel (UDP 5247)

		* Carries client data traffic encapsulated within CAPWAP.

Possible Problems:

	- Increase overhead due to encapsulation.

	- If the control tunnel fails AP looses WLC connection.

Conclusion:

	- CAPWAP uses seperate control and data tunnels for security and efficiency, enhancing centralized AP management.
