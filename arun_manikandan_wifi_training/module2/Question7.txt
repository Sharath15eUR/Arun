Objective -> To determine best AP mode for local network with remote WLC

What Happens?

	- WLC is remotely connected via WAN to local APs and clients

Why Consider Modes?

	- AP modes handle data forwarding and control differently impacting WAN performance

Which AP Mode is Best and How

	- FlexConnect best mode for remote WLC setups

How it Improves Local Network Performance

	- Local Data Forwarding AP forwards client data locally not over WAN reducing latency and improving speed

	- Centralized Control Local Survivability AP managed centrally but works if WAN fails ensuring local access

	- Scalability Flexibility Central management across sites with local performance optimization

How Other Modes Compare?

	- Local Mode All data goes over WAN causing latency and WAN congestion AP fails if WAN down

	- Autonomous Mode Lacks central management hard to manage consistently

Possible Problems

	- WAN Dependency for Control FlexConnect needs WAN for config and management outages impact this

	- Complexity of Configuration FlexConnect setup can be harder than Local Mode

Conclusion

	- FlexConnect best for remote WLC allowing local data forwarding better performance and local operation during WAN issues
