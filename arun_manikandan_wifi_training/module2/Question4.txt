Objective -.To compare lightweight APs and cloud-based APs in terms of functionality and deployment.

What are They?

    - Lightweight AP (LWAP): APs managed by on-premises WLC.

    - Cloud-based APs: APs managed via cloud-hosted controllers.

Why Cloud-based APs?

    - No need for on-site WLC.

    - Centralized cloud management for multiple locations.

How They Differ?

	Feature					Lightweight AP								Cloud-based AP
	
	Controller				On-prem WLC									Cloud-based
	Scalability				Limited to WLC capacity						Highly scalable
	Maintenance				Requires on-site management					Managed via cloud
	Initial Setup			More complex, requires WLC configuration	Often simpler, plug-and-play
	Data Forwarding			Local or tunneled to WLC					Often centralized through cloud or local
	Security				Organization's responsibility				Shared responsibility with cloud provider

Problems That Can Be Faced

    - Cloud-based APs require stable internet to connect to controllers.

    - LWAPs depend on WLC, which is a single point of failure.

Conclusion

	- Cloud APs offer scalability and remote management, while LWAPs provide local control with better latency.
