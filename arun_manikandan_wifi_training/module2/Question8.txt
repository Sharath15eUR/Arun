Objective -> Challenges of deploying 50+ autonomous APs in a university.

What Happens?

	- Many independent APs without central control in a large network.

Why is it Challenging

	- Autonomous APs lack central coordination.

What are the Challenges

	- Management Overhead : Configure each AP individually.

	- Inconsistent Configuration:  Different settings across APs.

	- Limited Scalability :  Manual setup for new APs is slow.

	- Poor Roaming :  Dropped or sticky connections for moving users.
	
  	- Radio Resource Management Issues :  Interference and poor performance.

	- Security Vulnerabilities :  Inconsistent and delayed security updates.

	- Troubleshooting Complexity :  Hard to diagnose issues without central view.

	- Lack of Centralized Monitoring :  No single dashboard for AP health.

	- Cost Inefficiency (Operational) :  High manual management costs.

Possible Problems

	- Increased IT workload and errors.

	- Inconsistent security policies.

	- Poor user experience.

Conclusion

	- Autonomous APs create major management scalability roaming security and efficiency problems in large networks. Central management is needed.
