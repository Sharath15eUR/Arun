Objective -> Impact of WLC failure on clients connected to LAP in local mode.

What Happens?

	- WLC managing local mode LAP fails.

Why is Local Mode Important?

	- LAP (Lightweight AP) bridges traffic locally not via WLC for data.

What Happens to Connected Clients

	- Existing Connections Remain : Current users stay connected and pass traffic.

	- No New Connections : New users cannot connect without WLC authentication.

	- No Roaming : Moving users lose connection between APs.

	- Loss of Management Functions : Cannot change settings or monitor LAP.

	- Security Policy Enforcement (Existing Clients) : Old security rules still apply no updates.

Possible Problems

	- New users cannot access Wi-Fi.

	- Users lose connection while moving.

	- Cannot manage or fix AP issues.

Conclusion

	- WLC failure keeps current users connected locally but blocks new users roaming and management of the AP.
