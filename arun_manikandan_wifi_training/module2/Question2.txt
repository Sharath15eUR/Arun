Objective -> To understand CAPWAP its flow between APs and WLC and its importance

What is CAPWAP?

	- Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) is a protocol used for managing APs from a centralized WLC over a secured tunnel.

Why CAPWAP?

	- Standard method for AP-WLC communication.

	- Securely manages APs over Layer 3 networks.

	- Reduces complexity in large wireless deployments.

How does CAPWAP Work?

	- AP discovers and establishes a connection with the WLC.

	- AP downloads its configurations from the WLC.

	- AP encapsulates data and control traffic inside the CAPWAP tunnel to WLC.

	- WLC manages all APs centrally.

AP-WLC Communication flow:

	- AP Discovery : AP finds the WLC using DHCP, or static configuration.

	- CAPWAP Establishment : AP and WLC establish secure tunnels for control and data.

	- AP joins WLC : AP gets its configuration and policies fromt eh WLC.

	- Client Authentication : WLC authenticates clients before allwoing network access.

Possible Problems:

	- CAPWAP increases latency if the WLC is far from AP.
	
	- If WLC falis AP's stop functioning in centralized mode.

Conclusion:

	- CAPWAP standardizes and secures AP management making wireless deployments more scalable and efficient.
