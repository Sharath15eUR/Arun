Objective -> To differentiate sniffer and monitor modes in wireless networks.

What are They?

    - Sniffer Mode: AP captures traffic and sends it to a remote analyzer.

    - Monitor Mode: AP scans RF environment for rogue devices.

Why Use These Modes?

    - Sniffer mode is used for troubleshooting.

    - Monitor mode is used for security and interference detection.

How They Work?

	Feature				Sniffer Mode							Monitor Mode

	Purpose				Capture packets							Detect threats
	Output				Sends data to analysis tool				Reports rogue APs
	Packet Detail		Captures full raw 802.11 frames			Captures frames but often focused on headers/metadata
	Association			Does not associate with any AP			Does not associate with any AP
	Primary Output		Raw packet captures (e.g., .pcap files)	Reports on detected devices (APs, clients), signal levels, frame types

Problems That Can Be Faced

    - Sniffer mode can cause performance degradation.

Conclusion

	- Both modes help in network monitoring but serve different purposes.
