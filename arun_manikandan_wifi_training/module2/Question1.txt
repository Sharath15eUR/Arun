Objective -> TO understand SplitMAC architecture its working and how it enhances the performance of APs.

What is SplitMAC?

	- SplitMAC is a wireless networking architecture where the functionalities of an AP are divided between the AP itself and a centralized Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).

	- The AP handles lower MAC layer operations (Ex : RF Management , Frame transmission,etc.), while the WLC manages higher MACC layer functions(Ex: Authentication , Association , etc).

Why SplitMAC?

	- Reduces the processing burden on the AP by delegation of control related tasks to the WLC.

	- Centralizes management.

	- Enables scalability as APs function with minimal intelligence and letting the WLC handle policies.

	- Improves security by delegating authentication and related tasks to WLC.		

How does SplitMAC improve AP Performance?

	- APs focus on forwarding frames and handling RF tasks thus making it perform better by reducing overhead on the AP.

	- The WLC manages decisions making sure it efficiently load balances providing better load distribution.

	- Ensures better network management with a single Point-of-Control leading to a centralized control.

SplitMAC Working

	- The AP captures the wireless frames and forwards the same to WLC over the CAPWAP(Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) tunnel.

	- WLC then processes these frames for Authentication, QoS and forwarding.

	- WLC sends these processed frame back to the AP which transmits the same to its client.

Possible Problems

	- If the WLC is overloadded, packet processing may be delayed. (Higher Latencies).

	- If the WLC fails al the APs relying on it will fail or lose functionality.

Conclusion

	- SplitMAC improves AP efficeincy by offloading control related functions to the WLC enabling scalablity performance and security in large wireless deployments.
