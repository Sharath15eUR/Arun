How 802.1X Enhances Wireless Network Security

	1. Strong Authentication Mechanism

		- Problem: Wireless networks are vulnerable to unauthorized access as data is transmitted over the air.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Uses centralized authentication with the 4-way handshake to verify devices, supporting strong EAP methods like EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, and EAP-TTLS. EAP-TLS ensures mutual authentication with digital certificates, making interception by attackers difficult.
	
	2. Mutual Authentication (Client and AP Authentication)

		- Problem: Traditional protocols only authenticate the client, leaving the network open to man-in-the-middle attacks.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Ensures mutual authentication between the client and AP using EAP methods (e.g., EAP-TLS) that require both parties to exchange certificates, preventing attackers from spoofing the AP.
	
	3. Encryption of Authentication Credentials

		- Problem: Credentials like passwords or keys sent in plaintext are vulnerable to interception.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: EAP methods encrypt authentication credentials and messages. WPA2/WPA3 further enhances security by generating a unique session key (PTK) to encrypt data traffic between the client and AP.
	
	4. Dynamic Key Management

		- Problem: Static encryption keys can be compromised over time.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Generates dynamic encryption keys for each session after successful authentication, reducing the risk of key compromise. If a key is compromised, only the current session is affected.
	
	5. Prevention of Rogue Access Points and Devices

		- Problem: Rogue access points set up by attackers can intercept data.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Requires devices to authenticate before accessing the network, blocking rogue devices. The RADIUS server ensures only authorized devices are allowed to connect.
	
	6. Granular Access Control

		- Problem: Unauthorized devices may gain access to sensitive parts of the network.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Integrates with Network Access Control (NAC) systems to enforce granular access policies based on user role, device health, or location, restricting access to certain network areas.
	
	7. Protection Against Replay Attacks

		- Problem: Attackers can intercept and replay valid authentication messages to gain unauthorized access.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: The 4-way handshake includes a unique nonce in each exchange, preventing replay attacks by ensuring that intercepted messages cannot be reused.

Conclusion:

	- 802.1X enhances wireless network security by addressing multiple vulnerabilities and providing strong, dynamic protections, including:
	
	    Strong authentication and mutual authentication between devices and access points.
	
	    Encryption of credentials to protect sensitive information during authentication.
	
	    Dynamic key management to generate unique session keys for encryption.
	
	    Prevention of unauthorized or rogue devices from gaining network access.
	
	    Granular access control to enforce policies based on device/user roles.
	
	    Protection against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks.
