Objective -> To understand the main foundations that keep Wi Fi networks safe.

What?	

	- The pillars of Wi Fi security are the key areas that protect wireless networks and ensure only the right people can connect and communicate safely.

Why?

	- Wi Fi is open by nature and can be easily attacked without protection.
	
	- Good security makes sure that data stays private.
	
	- Devices stay safe and hackers cannot misuse the network.

How?	

	- Wi Fi security uses rules methods and tools to control who can join the network.
	
	- Encrypt data during transfer and check if the devices are trusted.

Pillars:

	- There are mainly four pillars
	
	    1. Authentication

		    - Confirms if the person or device trying to connect is who they claim to be

		    - Example using a password or certificate.
	
	    2. Authorization

	    	- Gives permission to users to access certain resources

	    	- Example allowing a guest device only to access the internet but not printers.
	
	    3. Encryption

	   		- Protects data so that no one else can read it even if they capture it

	    	- Example using WPA3 to encrypt Wi Fi traffic.
	
	    4. Integrity

	    	- Makes sure that the data is not changed or tampered with during transfer
	   		- Example using message authentication codes.

Problems that can be faced

    - Weak passwords can lead to easy break ins.

    - Old security protocols like WEP are easily hacked.

    - Rogue access points can mimic trusted networks.

    - Poor device settings can create hidden backdoors.

    - If encryption is not strong hackers can steal sensitive data.

Conclusion:	

	- Wi Fi security is built on strong pillars like authentication authorization encryption and integrity.

	- Without them any Wi Fi system is open to big risks.
