Onejctive -> To understand the role of 802.1X in solving specific network security problems

Problems solved:

	1. Unauthorized Access to the Network

		- Problem: Devices can attempt to access the network without authentication, risking unauthorized access.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Implements a client-server authentication system (Supplicant, Authenticator, and Authentication Server), ensuring only devices with valid credentials can access the network.
	
	2. Lack of Centralized Control for Authentication

		- Problem: Managing authentication manually in large networks is error-prone and inefficient.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Uses a RADIUS server for centralized authentication, storing and managing credentials securely for consistent device verification.
	
	3. Weaknesses in Traditional Network Access Control

		- Problem: Traditional methods like static passwords or WEP are easily bypassed.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Supports strong authentication methods (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP), including client-server certificates for secure mutual authentication.
	
	4. Lack of Device and User Authentication in Wireless Networks

		- Problem: Wireless networks are vulnerable to unauthorized access due to data transmission over the air.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Acts as port-based authentication in wireless networks, using EAP methods to authenticate devices before allowing network access.
	
	5. Network Access Without User Credentials

		- Problem: Network access is needed based on user or device identity, not just physical connection.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Allows user-specific authentication (e.g., username and password), enabling granular control over network access.
	
	6. Prevention of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

		- Problem: Attackers can impersonate the network or spoof devices, intercepting communication.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Uses mutual authentication (e.g., EAP-TLS) and digital certificates to ensure both parties are legitimate, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
	
	7. Network Access Control Based on Policy

		- Problem: Access to resources needs to be controlled based on user role or device compliance.

		- How 802.1X Solves It: Integrates with Network Access Control (NAC) systems, enforcing policies like device health or security patch compliance before granting network access.

Conclusion

	- 802.1X solves several key problems related to network security, primarily focused on ensuring authorized access to the network and protecting against unauthorized access. It provides:

	    Centralized authentication

	    Stronger, more secure authentication methods

	    Protection from unauthorized devices

	    Increased security for wireless networks

	    Network access control based on device or user credentials
