Objective -> To understand the role of the Pairwise Master Key (PMK) in the 4-way handshake.

What is the 4-Way Handshake?

	- The 4-way handshake is a process used in WPA and WPA2 to securely establish a connection between a client device (e.g., laptop, phone) and an access point (AP).

	- The handshake is used to:

	   * Confirm that both the client and the AP know the correct Pairwise Master Key (PMK).

	   * Generate fresh session keys for encryption during communication.

Role of the PMK in the 4-Way Handshake

    Step 1: The Access Point (AP) sends a nonce (random number) to the client.

        * This nonce is used to prevent replay attacks and ensures fresh keys are generated.

    Step 2: The client responds with its own nonce and a Message Integrity Code (MIC) that verifies the message's authenticity.

    Step 3: The AP sends back a message to the client containing the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) and Group Temporal Key (GTK).

        * The PTK is derived from the PMK, the AP’s nonce, and the client’s nonce. This PTK is used for encryption and decryption of the communication data.

        * The GTK is used for encrypting broadcast and multicast traffic.

    Step 4: The client confirms receipt of the PTK and GTK, completing the handshake.

Importance:

	- Key Agreement

	- Protection Against Replay Attacks

	- Session Key Generation

Conclusion:"

	- The Pairwise Master Key (PMK) plays a crucial role in WPA2 security by providing the foundation for generating session keys that protect the communication between the client and access point.
