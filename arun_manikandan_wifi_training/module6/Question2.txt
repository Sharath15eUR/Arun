Objective -> To underwtand the difference between authentication and encryption.

What?

	Authentication

		- It is the process of checking if a user or device is real and allowed to connect.
	
	Encryption

		- It is the process of turning data into a secret code so that even if someone captures it they cannot understand it.

Why?	

	- Authentication is needed to stop unknown devices from joining the network.
	
	- Encryption is needed to keep the data safe while it travels through the air.

How?

    - In authentication the Wi Fi system asks for a password certificate or something similar before allowing access.

    - In encryption after the user is allowed data is changed into unreadable form using methods like WPA2 or WPA3.

Working:	

	1. Authentication:

		- When we try to connect to a WiFi network, your device usually sends credentials (like a password or digital certificate).

		- The WiFi router or authentication server checks these credentials.

		- If valid, you are allowed onto the network.

		- Examples of authentication protocols include WPA2-PSK (Pre-Shared Key) and WPA2-Enterprise (using username/password or certificates).
	
	2. Encryption:

		- Once you are authenticated, the WiFi system establishes a secure communication channel.

		- A shared encryption key is created (or securely exchanged) between your device and the router.

		- All the data you send or receive is then encrypted using protocols like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), making it unreadable to outsiders.

Conclusion:

	- Authentication ensures that only trusted devices/users connect to the network.

	- Encryption ensures that the information shared remains private and protected from unauthorized access.
