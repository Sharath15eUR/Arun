Objective -> To understand the differences between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.

What?

	- WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was the first WiFi security protocol designed to make wireless networks as secure as wired networks.
	
	- WPA (WiFi Protected Access) was developed as a quick replacement for WEP when serious flaws were discovered.
	
	- WPA2 is an improvement over WPA, offering stronger security mechanisms, especially for modern wireless networks.
	
	- WPA3 is the latest standard, designed to address new types of attacks and improve protection even on weak passwords.

Why?

		- WEP was found to be highly vulnerable — attackers could break into a WEP-protected network within minutes.
		
		- WPA was introduced as a stopgap solution to quickly patch the vulnerabilities of WEP.
		
		- WPA2 provided a full and proper security framework suitable for long-term use.
		
		- WPA3 was needed because even WPA2 started showing weaknesses, especially against newer, smarter hacking techniques like brute-force password guessing.

Working:

	WEP:

	    - Uses the RC4 stream cipher for encryption with a static key.

	    - It uses a small Initialization Vector (IV), making it easy for attackers to predict the key by capturing enough packets.

    WPA:

	    - Introduces TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) to dynamically change encryption keys during the session.

	    - It still uses RC4 internally but adds more complexity to make attacks harder.

    WPA2:

    	- Replaces TKIP with CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) based on AES encryption.

   		- AES is far more secure and robust than RC4.
   		
    	- WPA2 can run in Personal mode (home networks) with a pre-shared key or Enterprise mode (corporate networks) with a RADIUS server.

    WPA3:

    	- Introduces Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) instead of PSK, making password guessing much harder.

    	- It mandates stronger encryption (192-bit in Enterprise mode) and forward secrecy (so that even if someone captures encrypted traffic today, they cannot decrypt it later even if they learn the password).

Conclusion:

	- The evolution from WEP → WPA → WPA2 → WPA3 shows how WiFi security has improved step-by-step to keep up with advancing hacking techniques.
