Objective -> To understand major innovation in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)

What is Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)?

	- Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) is the next-generation Wi-Fi standard designed to further enhance wireless network performance.
	- It main focuses for high-bandwidth applications like AR/VR, 4K/8K video streaming, gaming, and large-scale IoT devices.

Why is Wi-Fi 7 Important?

	- Wi-Fi 7 is designed to handle:

	    * A growing number of connected devices.

	    * Increasing network speeds.

	    * More demanding applications (e.g., AR/VR, smart cities, and immersive media).

	- With the rise of 4K/8K content and high-demand applications, Wi-Fi 7 is set to meet the growing need for high-performance, ultra-low-latency wireless communication.

Major Innvoations:

	1. 320 MHz Channel Width:
	
	    - Wi-Fi 7 doubles the maximum channel width to 320 MHz compared to Wi-Fi 6’s 160 MHz on the 6 GHz band.

	2. Multi-Link Operation (MLO):
	
	    - MLO allows devices to transmit data across multiple frequency bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) simultaneously.

	3. 4096-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):
	
	    - Wi-Fi 7 uses a higher modulation scheme of 4096-QAM (up from 1024-QAM in Wi-Fi 6), allowing more data to be transmitted per symbol.

	4. Enhanced MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple Input Multiple Output):
	
	    - Wi-Fi 7 supports up to 16 streams of MU-MIMO, compared to Wi-Fi 6’s 8 streams.

	5. Lower Latency:
	
	   - Wi-Fi 7 introduces features like Multi-Link Operation, improved scheduling, and enhanced Target Wake Time (TWT) for IoT devices, reducing latency.

	6. Better Channel Access with New Protocols:
	
	    - Wi-Fi 7 introduces the 802.11be protocol, which optimizes time allocation for better channel access.

Problems taht can be faced:

	- Wi-Fi 7 will require new hardware, both for routers and client devices, which might take time for widespread adoption.

	- Higher frequency bands, like the 6 GHz band, are susceptible to interference and signal attenuation over long distances or through obstacles.

	- While Wi-Fi 7 offers better performance, especially with Multi-Link Operation and wider channels, the 6 GHz band has a shorter range compared to lower frequencies like 2.4 GHz.

Conclusion:

	- Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) introduces several innovative features that drastically improve network performance:
	
	    * 320 MHz channel widths for faster speeds.
	
	    * Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for efficient use of spectrum.
	
	    * 4096-QAM for higher data rates and improved efficiency.
	
	    * Enhanced MU-MIMO for better capacity in dense environments.
	
	    * Ultra-low latency for real-time applications.
	
	    * Improved channel access protocols for handling congestion better.
