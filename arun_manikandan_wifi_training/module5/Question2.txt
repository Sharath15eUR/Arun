Objective -> To understand what OFDMA is, why it was introduced in Wi-Fi 6, how it works.

What is OFDMA?

    - OFDMA stands for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access.

    - Its a technique where a Wi-Fi channel is divided into smaller sub-channels (called Resource Units or RUs).

    - Each sub-channel can be assigned to different devices simultaneously.

Why OFDMA was introduced?

	- In Wi-Fi 5 and older:

	    * Devices had to wait for their turn to use the full channel.

	    * Idle time and inefficiencies increased, especially when many devices (smartphones, IoT gadgets) were connected.

	    * Congestion and delay happened in crowded places (airports, offices, stadiums).

	- OFDMA solves this by:

	    * Reducing wait times,

	    * Allowing multiple small data transmissions at once,

	    * Maximizing spectrum use.

How OFDMA Works?

	- Imagine the Wi-Fi channel like a highway:

	- Without OFDMA (Wi-Fi 5):

	    * Only one truck (device) could use all lanes at once to deliver goods (data), even if it had just a small package.

	    * Huge waste of road space when small deliveries are happening.

	- With OFDMA (Wi-Fi 6):

	    * Multiple trucks (devices) can use different lanes at the same time.

	    * Small deliveries don’t block the whole road.

	    * Big deliveries can still use multiple lanes if needed.

	- More technically:

	    * A 20 MHz Wi-Fi channel could be split into multiple smaller RUs like 2 MHz or 4 MHz units.

	    * The router coordinates the transmissions → multiple users send/receive data simultaneously over different parts of the spectrum.

Problems that can be faced

   - Both the router and the end devices must support OFDMA to get the full benefit.
    
   - Improperly tuned networks might not fully leverage OFDMA; it requires smart management.

   - If you have very few devices (like just one or two), OFDMA’s impact might not be very noticeable.

Conclusion

	- OFDMA is one of the most important innovations in Wi-Fi 6.

	- It transforms Wi-Fi from a one-at-a-time system into a true multi-user system by letting multiple devices share a single channel simultaneously.
