Objective -> To understand the concept of Multi-Link Operation (MLO) in Wi-Fi 7

 What is Multi-Link Operation (MLO)?

	- Multi-Link Operation (MLO) is a feature introduced in Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) that enables a single device to communicate simultaneously across multiple frequency bands, such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz. 

	- This allows devices to transmit and receive data in parallel, improving throughput and reducing latency.

Why is Multi-Link Operation (MLO) Important?

	- MLO is critical for addressing the growing need for higher data rates, stable connections, and low latency required by high-demand applications such as:

	    * 4K/8K video streaming

	    * Real-time communication (e.g., AR/VR)

	    * Online gaming

	- By using multiple frequency bands simultaneously, MLO optimizes the use of available spectrum, which results in more efficient communication.

How MLO Works?

	- MLO enhances communication by allowing devices to use the following:

	    * Multiple Frequency Bands: Devices can communicate across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands at the same time.

	    * Load Balancing: Traffic is offloaded onto less congested bands, improving network capacity and reducing congestion.

	    * Redundancy: If one band experiences interference or congestion, another band can take over, ensuring continuous and reliable communication.

Impact on Latency

	- Latency is the delay between sending a data packet and receiving a response.

	- Reduced Latency:

	    * MLO reduces latency by enabling devices to communicate across multiple channels simultaneously, speeding up data transmission.

	    * MLO also helps avoid congestion by distributing traffic across bands, minimizing delays.

Impact on Throughput

	- Throughput is the amount of data transmitted over the network per unit of time.

	- Increased Throughput:

	    * MLO aggregates bandwidth from multiple bands, allowing devices to transmit and receive data faster.

	- This results in higher speeds and better network performance, especially in high-demand scenarios like streaming and gaming.

Problems taht can be faced:

	- Both client devices and routers must support Wi-Fi 7 and MLO to fully take advantage of this feature.

	- Using multiple bands can sometimes lead to interference, particularly in crowded environments.

	- MLO increases power consumption since it requires simultaneous operation across multiple bands.

Conclusion:

	- Multi-Link Operation (MLO) in Wi-Fi 7 is a powerful feature that offers:
	
	    * Higher throughput by aggregating bandwidth from multiple frequency bands, leading to faster speeds and better data rates.
	
	    * Reduced latency by transmitting data across several bands in parallel, enhancing real-time applications like gaming, video conferencing, and AR/VR.
	
	    * It is an important tool for optimizing network performance, especially in environments with high device density and bandwidth demands.
