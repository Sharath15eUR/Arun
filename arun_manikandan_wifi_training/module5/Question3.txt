Objective -> To understand the role of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6

What is Target Wake Time (TWT)?

    - TWT is a feature introduced in Wi-Fi 6 that helps devices save power by scheduling when they need to wake up and communicate over the network.

    - Instead of constantly listening for transmissions (which uses a lot of power), devices can wake up only at scheduled times, check for data, and then go back to sleep. 

Why TWT was introduced

    - IoT devices like smart sensors, cameras, and thermostats typically dont need to send data continuously. However, previous Wi-Fi standards (like Wi-Fi 5) required devices to constantly check for data, which led to significant battery drain.

    - With the rise of IoT and the need for more efficient power consumption, TWT was introduced to allow devices to operate for longer periods without frequent recharging.

How TWT Works

   -  Scheduling Wake Times:
    
	    * In Wi-Fi 6, devices and the access point (AP) negotiate when each device should wake up to transmit or receive data.

	    * This reduces the idle time during which devices would otherwise be consuming energy. They only wake up during their assigned times, leading to better battery efficiency.

How TWT Benefits IoT Devices

    1. Power Efficiency:

    	* Since IoT devices dont have to constantly stay awake or keep checking for data, they consume much less energy, leading to longer battery life.

    2. Reduced Congestion:

	    * Since devices wake up only when needed, theres  less network traffic congestion because fewer devices are trying to transmit data at the same time. 

	    * This makes the network more efficient, especially in environments with many connected devices.

    3. Better for IoT:

   		* IoT devices often dont need high bandwidth or low latency. 
   		
   		* TWT is perfect for devices that only send small amounts of data, as it helps them conserve energy without affecting performance.
   		
Problems that can be faced

    - Configuring TWT requires proper coordination between the device and the router. Devices need to support TWT, and the AP needs to manage the schedules for different devices.

    - Devices that donâ€™t support Wi-Fi 6 will not benefit from TWT, which limits its usefulness in older devices or networks.
    
    - While TWT helps save power, time-sensitive applications (like real-time security monitoring) might experience slight delays if the device has to wait until its scheduled wake time.

Conclusion

	- Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 is a revolutionary feature for IoT devices.

	- It significantly reduces power consumption and increases battery life.
