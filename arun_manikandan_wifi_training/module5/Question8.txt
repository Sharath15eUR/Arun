Objective -> To understand the purpose of 802.11k and 802.11v standards and how they improve roaming in wireless networks.

What are 802.11k and 802.11v?

	- 802.11k and 802.11v are extensions to the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standards designed to enhance wireless network performance, particularly in terms of roaming.

	    * 802.11k focuses on radio resource management. It enables devices to make more informed decisions about which access point (AP) to connect to when roaming.

	    * 802.11v enhances network management and roaming optimization. It provides more efficient information about the network environment, helping devices manage their connections during roaming.

Why are 802.11k and 802.11v Important for Roaming?

	- In wireless networks, especially with multiple access points (APs) across large spaces, roaming occurs when a device moves from the range of one AP to another. 

	- A seamless transition is critical for applications like VoIP, video conferencing, and real-time streaming, where latency and downtime can severely affect performance.

	- Both 802.11k and 802.11v improve how devices and APs coordinate, allowing for smoother transitions between APs, reducing poor connections, signal drops, and unnecessary delays.

How Do 802.11k and 802.11v Aid in Roaming?

    1. 802.11k: Radio Resource Management

        * Neighbor Reports: Devices can request a report from an AP that lists nearby APs, their signal strength, channel information, etc. This helps devices make better roaming decisions.

        * Channel Scanning: Devices can scan channels more efficiently to reduce the handoff time.

        * Load Balancing: 802.11k helps devices select less congested APs, improving overall performance.

    2. 802.11v: Network Management and Roaming Optimization

        * BSS Transition Management: This feature allows APs to suggest or direct devices to other APs for better performance based on factors like signal strength or AP load.

        * AP Advertisement: APs can advertise their capabilities, including roaming options, helping devices make smarter roaming decisions.

        * Power Save Mode: Devices can conserve power by avoiding frequent channel scanning during roaming.

Benefits of 802.11k and 802.11v in Roaming:	

	- Real-time data about nearby APs allows faster, more reliable handoffs.

	- Devices can avoid congested APs, ensuring more balanced traffic distribution.

	- Ppower consumption is reduced as devices donâ€™t need to scan for new APs as frequently.

Problems thatt can be faced:

	- Not all devices support 802.11k and 802.11v.

	- Proper network configuration is essential.

Conclusion:

	- The 802.11k and 802.11v standards significantly enhance roaming by improving both radio resource management (802.11k) and network management (802.11v). They allow for:
	
	    * More informed roaming decisions based on nearby AP conditions.
	
	    * Smarter roaming with suggestions for better APs.
