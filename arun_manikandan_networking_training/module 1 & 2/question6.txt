How to remote access a system?

METHOD 1 : VNC Viewer

	- To access a remote system using the VNC Viewer we first have to install the necessary packages on linux/distros using the following command : 

	sudo apt install tightvncserver

	- Once the installation is done we can verify the same by running the following

	vncserver

	- To actually the remote system we need to know the IP of the system to be controlled and execture the following : 

	vncviewer <ip_addr>

	example usage : vncviewer 172.16.60.297


METHOD 2 : Anydesk

	- To remote access a system using Anydesk we download the client on both the systems at first

	- Once its installed the next step is to use the 9-digit access key from the client.

	- After entering the same the remote system should accept the connection and the remote access is established.


METHOD 3 : SSH

	- Install openssh-server on the system using the following commnad : 

	sudo apt install -y openssh-server

	- After installation start the service and enable the same using systemctl:

	sudo systemctl enable ssh

	sudo systemctl start ssh

	- Once the above steps are done on both systems we can access the remote system securely using the ip address of the remote system

	ssh <username>@<ip_addr>

	example usage : ssh arun@172.16.60.109
