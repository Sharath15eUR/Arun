Objective ->  Identify the class of each IP address.Determine if it is private or public.Explain how NAT would handle a private IP when accessing the internet.

Given IP's:

	- 192.168.10.5
	- 172.20.15.1
	-  8.8.8.8


Identifying the classes:

	IP Address			Class			Reason
	
	192.168.10.5		Class C			Ranges from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
	
	172.20.15.1			Class B			Ranges from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
	
	8.8.8.8				Class A			Ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255


Determining if it is Private or Public IP:

	- 192.168.10.5 is Private IP because it is a part of 192.168.0.0/16 which is reserved for private usage.

	- 172.20.15.1 is Private IP because it is a part of 172.20.0.0/12 which is reserved for private usage.

	- 8.8.8.8 is Public IP that is provided by Google as part of Google's DNS server


How to find if an IP is public or private?

	- If an IP falls in any of these ranges it is private:

		* 10.0.0.0/8
		* 172.16.0.0/12
		* 192.168.0.0/16

	- If it doesnt fall in that block range then it is a public IP address/.

How NAT handles a Private IP when using internet?

	- NAT or Network Address Translation allows devices with Private IP address to communicate with devices of external network.

	- This is acheived by mapping the private IP to that of a public IP address.

	- When a private IP wants to access internet the following is done by NAT:

		* Private IP is translated into public IP address by router performing NAT.

		* The router then keeps track of connection using NAT table which is repsonsible to map Private to Public IP translations.

		* When a response is received the router looks up the NAT table and translates the Public IP back into Private IP address.

		* This packet is then delivered to the device that made the request.

Example:

	- Internal IP -> 192.168.10.5

	- NAT Translated IP -> 203.0.113.1

	- Public IP -> 203.0.113.1

	- Reply from server is sent to 203.0.113.1

	- NAT then looks up the table and translates 203.0.113.1 to 192.168.10.5

	- The reply is then sent to the translated IP by the router

Problems that can be faced:

	- NAT Overload -> Too many private IP's are being translated -> Increase the number of available IP's to solve.

	- IP conflict -> Private IP overlaps with the Public IP range -> Use only defined IP provided by rules.

Conclusion:

	-Secure and Efficient IP address translation.

	- Proper communication between internal and external networks.
