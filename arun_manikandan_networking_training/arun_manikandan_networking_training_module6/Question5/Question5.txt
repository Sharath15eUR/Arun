Objective → Network Address Translation (NAT) Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer

What is NAT (Network Address Translation):

    - NAT allows a private network to connect to external public networks (like the internet) using a single public IP address.

    - It translates private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x) to a public IP address, enabling internet access for devices on the private network.

    - NAT is essential because IPv4 addresses are limited and private IP addresses cannot directly access public networks.

How NAT Works:

    -Private to Public Translation:
        * Devices in a private network use private IP addresses (192.168.x.x) for internal communication.
        * When a device wants to access the internet, the NAT router replaces the source IP (private IP) with a public IP.

    - Maintaining Connection:
        * NAT creates a translation table to remember the internal-private to external-public mapping.
        * When the external server responds, NAT reverses the process — replacing the public IP with the original private IP.

Types of NAT:

    - Static NAT – One-to-one mapping between private and public IP.

    - Dynamic NAT – Maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs.

    - PAT (Port Address Translation) – Maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using different port numbers.

Example:

    - Private IP: 192.168.1.10

    - Public IP (assigned to router): 10.0.0.1

	When 192.168.1.10 sends a ping to 10.0.0.2, NAT translates the packet like:

	192.168.1.10 → 10.0.0.1 → 10.0.0.2

	When the reply comes back:

	10.0.0.2 → 10.0.0.1 → 192.168.1.10

Steps to Configure NAT:
	1. Setup the Network:

	    - Create a network with:

	        2 PCs connected to a switch.
	        Connect the switch to Router0 using a GigabitEthernet interface.
	        Connect Router0 to Server0 using another GigabitEthernet interface (instead of Router1).
	        Set up Server0 to simulate an external network with a static IP.

	2. Assign IP Addresses:

			PC1:

			IP: 192.168.1.10  
			Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
			Gateway: 192.168.1.1  

			PC2:

			IP: 192.168.1.20  
			Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
			Gateway: 192.168.1.1  

			Router0:

			Gigabit0/0 → 192.168.1.1 (Private Network)  
			Gigabit0/1 → 10.0.0.1 (Connected to Server0)  

			Server0:

			IP: 10.0.0.2  
			Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
			Gateway: 10.0.0.1  

	3. Configure NAT on Router0:

    	- Define the private network:

			Router0(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255  

    	- Set up NAT to translate private IPs to the public IP:

			Router0(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 interface Gigabit0/1 overload  

   		- Mark internal and external interfaces:

			Router0(config)# interface Gigabit0/0  
			Router0(config-if)# ip nat inside  
			Router0(config-if)# exit  

			Router0(config)# interface Gigabit0/1  
			Router0(config-if)# ip nat outside  
			Router0(config-if)# exit  

    	- Set up a static route to reach the server:

			Router0(config)# ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2  

	4. Configure Server0 to Simulate an External Network:

    	Since Server0 is directly connected, no additional configuration is required apart from assigning the IP and gateway.

	5. Test NAT Configuration:

	    From PC1:
	    Ping the server to test NAT:

			C:\> ping 10.0.0.2  

   		 From Router0:

    	Check NAT translations:

			Router# show ip nat translations  
			Example output of successful NAT translation:

			Pro  Inside global     Inside local       Outside local      Outside global  
			icmp 10.0.0.1:1        192.168.1.20:1     10.0.0.2:1         10.0.0.2:1  
			icmp 10.0.0.1:2        192.168.1.10:2     10.0.0.2:2         10.0.0.2:2

Issues That Can Be Faced:

	1. Ping Fails:

	   * NAT misconfigured — Check if ip nat inside and ip nat outside are set correctly.
	   * Incorrect ACL — Ensure that the access list permits internal addresses.
	   * Loopback on Router1 is down — Ensure that the loopback interface is active (no shutdown).

	2. No NAT Translations Visible:

	   * NAT might not be set up on the correct interfaces — Verify ip nat inside and ip nat outside.

	3. One-Way Communication:

	   * No static route on Router1 — Ensure the default route (0.0.0.0) is pointing to the loopback.

Behavior After Successful NAT:

    - PC's private IP (192.168.1.20) is translated to public IP (10.0.0.1) before leaving Router0.

    - Router1 receives packets with source IP as 10.0.0.1 and sends a reply.

    - NAT table on Router0 tracks the mapping and translates the packet back to 192.168.1.20 when the response comes.

Why NAT is Used in Real-World Networks:

    - Preserves IPv4 addresses due to shortage of public IPs.

    - Allows internal networks to communicate with external networks securely.

    - NAT adds a layer of security by hiding internal IPs from the external network.

Conclusion:

    - NAT allows private networks to access the internet using a single public IP address.

    - This setup demonstrated how to configure and test NAT in a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation.

    - Troubleshooting included misconfigured interfaces, incorrect ACLs, and missing routes.
