Objective -> Divide the network into 4 subnets

What is subnetting?

    - Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). It allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, improved network security, and better network organization.


We are given the IP address range: 10.0.0.0/24 and we need to subnet the same into 4 subnetworks

Steps to subnet:

   - Analysing the given IP

       - 10.0.0.0/24 belongs to the Class A Range of IP Address with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0

       - The /24 in the IP tells us that there are 2^8 total addresses i.e., 256 total addresses

       - The valid range would be 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 (256 addresses including 10.0.0.0 and 10.0.0.255)

       - The first IP address is always set as the network address so 10.0.0.0 -> Network Address

       - The last IP address is always set as the broadcast address so 10.0.0.255 -> Broadcast Address

   - Dividing into subnets

       - We need to increase the subnet bits to create 4 subnets, thus to create 4 subnets we need 2 additional bits

       - 2^2 = 4 bits, thus the new subnet mask would be /26 -> 255.255.255.192

Subnet Calculation

	Subnet			Network Address			First Usable IP			Last Usable IP			Broadcast Address
	
	1				10.0.0.0/26				10.0.0.1				10.0.0.62				10.0.0.63
	
	2				10.0.0.64/26			10.0.0.65				10.0.0.126				10.0.0.127
	
	3				10.0.0.128/26			10.0.0.129				10.0.0.190				10.0.0.191
	
	4				10.0.0.192/26			10.0.0.193				10.0.0.254				10.0.0.255

Steps:

    - Open Cisco Packet Tracer

    - Create a network with 4 devices each connected to a switch connected to a router (Ref to Setup Image)

    - Assign IP address to the same for example:

		Device			Subnet			IP Address			Subnet Mask			Gateway
		PC1				Subnet 1		10.0.0.10			255.255.255.192		10.0.0.1
		PC2				Subnet 2		10.0.0.70			255.255.255.192		10.0.0.65
		PC3				Subnet 3		10.0.0.130			255.255.255.192		10.0.0.129
		PC4				Subnet 4		10.0.0.200			255.255.255.192		10.0.0.193

    - Connect devices using the switch

    - Configure the static IP routes on the router

    - Configure the router using:

    	enable
    	configure terminal
    	
    	interface GigabitEthernet0/0
    	ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.192
    	no shutdown
    	exit
    	
    	interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    	ip address 10.0.0.65 255.255.255.192
    	no shutdown
    	exit
    	
    	interface GigabitEthernet0/2
    	ip address 10.0.0.129 255.255.255.192
    	no shutdown
    	exit
    	
    	interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    	ip address 10.0.0.193 255.255.255.192
    	no shutdown
    	exit
    	
    	ip route 10.0.0.64 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.65
    	ip route 10.0.0.128 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.129
    	ip route 10.0.0.192 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.193
    	
    	copy running-config startup-config
    	
    	show interfaces brief
    	show ip interface brief
    	show ip route
    	

Common Problems faced:

    - PC cannot ping its gateway -> Incorrect gateway IP on PC -> Verify and correct gateway IP on PC.

    - PC cannot ping a PC in a different subnet -> Missing static route on router -> Add static route on router to destination network.

    - Router interface is down -> Cable unplugged or faulty -> Check cable connection and replace if needed.

    - Ping fails intermittently -> IP address conflict -> Assign unique IP addresses to devices.

Conclusion:

    Thus by understanding how to subnet a network one can efficiently configure any real-world network and ensure better connectivity.
