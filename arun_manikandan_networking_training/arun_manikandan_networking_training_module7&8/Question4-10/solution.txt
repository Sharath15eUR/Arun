Objective -> VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing Detailed Configuration Guide

TASK 1: CREATE VLANs AND ASSIGN PORTS

What is VLAN?
    - VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows you to segment a physical switch into multiple logical networks. 
    - Devices within the same VLAN can communicate directly, while communication between different VLANs requires routing.

Why Use VLANs?
    - Improved network segmentation and isolation.
    - Reduces broadcast traffic and increases security.

How It Works:
    - When you create a VLAN, the switch creates a separate broadcast domain.
    - Ports assigned to a VLAN can only communicate with other ports in the same VLAN.

Switch 0 Configuration:
    1. Enter configuration mode:
        enable
        configure terminal

    2. Create VLAN 10 and VLAN 20:
        vlan 10
        name Engineering

        vlan 20
        name Sales

    3. Assign ports to VLANs:
        interface fastEthernet 0/1
        switchport mode access
        switchport access vlan 10

        interface fastEthernet 0/2
        switchport mode access
        switchport access vlan 20

    4. Exit configuration mode:
        exit

Verification:
    - Use the following command to verify VLAN assignment:
        show vlan brief

(Refer to `Initial_Setup.png`)

TASK 2: CONFIGURE TRUNK PORT BETWEEN SWITCHES

What is a Trunk Port?
    - A trunk port allows multiple VLAN traffic to pass between switches over a single physical link.
    - Trunk ports use 802.1Q encapsulation to tag frames with the VLAN ID.

Why Use Trunk Ports?
    - To allow communication between VLANs across switches.
    - Prevents the need for separate physical links for each VLAN.

How It Works:
    - 802.1Q tags each frame with the VLAN ID.
    - The receiving switch reads the tag and forwards the frame to the correct VLAN.

Switch 0 Configuration:
    1. Enter configuration mode:
        enable
        configure terminal

    2. Set port as trunk:
        interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
        switchport mode trunk
        switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
        no shutdown

    3. Exit configuration mode:
        exit

Switch 1 Configuration:
    1. Enter configuration mode:
        enable
        configure terminal

    2. Set port as trunk:
        interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
        switchport mode trunk
        switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
        no shutdown

    3. Exit configuration mode:
        exit

Verification:
    - Check trunk status using:
        show interfaces trunk

(Refer to `Switch0_Trunk_Interface.png` and `Switch1_Trunk_Interface.png`)

TASK 3: CREATE MANAGEMENT VLAN (VLAN 99)

What is a Management VLAN?
    - A VLAN used specifically for managing network devices.
    - Usually isolated from normal data traffic for security.

Why Use a Management VLAN?
    - To prevent unauthorized access to management interfaces.
    - Provides secure access for network administrators.

How It Works:
    - Switch assigns an IP address to the management VLAN.
    - The IP is used for remote access (SSH, Telnet, etc.).

Switch 0 Configuration:
    1. Enter configuration mode:
        enable
        configure terminal

    2. Create VLAN 99:
        vlan 99
        name Management

    3. Assign IP address to VLAN 99:
        interface vlan 99
        ip address 192.168.99.1 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    4. Set default gateway:
        ip default-gateway 192.168.99.254

    5. Assign port to VLAN 99:
        interface fastEthernet 0/3
        switchport mode access
        switchport access vlan 99

    6. Exit configuration mode:
        exit

Verification:
    - Use the following commands to verify:
        show ip interface brief
        show vlan brief

(Refer to `Created_Management_VLAN.png`)

TASK 4: SET UP SSH ON SWITCH

What is SSH?
    - SSH (Secure Shell) allows secure remote access to network devices over an encrypted connection.

Why Use SSH?
    - Encrypts data to prevent eavesdropping.
    - Provides secure login access to the switch.

How It Works:
    - RSA keys are generated for encryption.
    - VTY lines are configured to allow SSH login.

Switch 0 Configuration:
    1. Enter configuration mode:
        enable
        configure terminal

    2. Set hostname and domain:
        hostname Switch0
        ip domain-name example.com

    3. Generate RSA keys:
        crypto key generate rsa

    4. Create user credentials:
        username admin privilege 15 secret Cisco123

    5. Enable SSH on VTY lines:
        line vty 0 4
        transport input ssh
        login local
        exit

Verification:
    - Test SSH access:
        ssh admin@192.168.99.1

(Refer to `Set_ssh_on_Switch.png`)

TASK 5: CONFIGURE ROUTER-ON-A-STICK (ROAS)

What is ROAS?
    - Router-on-a-Stick allows a single router interface to handle traffic from multiple VLANs using subinterfaces.

Why Use ROAS?
    - To enable inter-VLAN communication using a single physical link.

How It Works:
    - Router creates subinterfaces.
    - 802.1Q tags are used to identify VLAN traffic.

Router Configuration:
    1. Enter configuration mode:
        enable
        configure terminal

    2. Enable main interface:
        interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
        no shutdown

    3. Create subinterface for VLAN 10:
        interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.10
        encapsulation dot1Q 10
        ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    4. Create subinterface for VLAN 20:
        interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.20
        encapsulation dot1Q 20
        ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
        no shutdown

    5. Enable IP routing:
        ip routing

    6. Exit configuration mode:
        exit

Verification:
    - Use the following commands to verify:
        show ip interface brief
        show ip route

(Refer to `Router_Config_for_VLAN.png`)

TASK 6: TROUBLESHOOTING

    - If inter-VLAN communication fails:
        - Ensure trunking is enabled.
        - Check IP addresses and VLAN assignment.

    - If SSH fails:
        - Ensure VTY lines are configured.
        - Make sure RSA keys are generated.

    - If router doesnâ€™t forward packets:
        - Ensure `ip routing` is enabled on the router.

TASK 7: FINAL CONFIGURATION OVERVIEW

    - VLANs created: VLAN 10, VLAN 20, VLAN 99
    - Trunk ports set up
    - Router-on-a-Stick configured
    - SSH enabled
    - Inter-VLAN communication verified

(Refer to `Updated_Setup_for_InterVLAN.png`)

CONCLUSION
    - VLANs and inter-VLAN routing are working correctly.
    - SSH is configured for secure remote access.
    - VLAN mismatch fixed.
    - Setup is clean and operational!
