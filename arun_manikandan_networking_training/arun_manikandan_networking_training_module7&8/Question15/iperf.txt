Objective -> Use iPerf to understand the output

What is iPerf?
iPerf is a network performance testing tool used to measure bandwidth, throughput, latency, and jitter between two devices over a network connection. It creates and sends traffic between a client and server to analyze network behavior under different conditions.

How iPerf Works
    - Client-Server Model:
        - One device acts as the server – listens for connections.
        - Another device acts as the client – sends data to the server.
    - Protocols Supported:
        - TCP → Measures connection reliability and bandwidth.
        - UDP → Measures latency, jitter, and packet loss.
    - Direction:
        - Unidirectional – Measures one-way transmission.
        - Bidirectional – Measures both upload and download simultaneously.
    - Parallel Streams:
        - Multiple streams increase load to test network handling.
    - Multicast:
        - Tests multicast communication over UDP.

Why iPerf?
    - Lightweight and simple to use.
    - Platform-independent (available on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS).
    - Measures actual bandwidth (not theoretical).
    - Useful for diagnosing:
        - Network bottlenecks
        - Packet loss
        - Jitter and delay issues
        - TCP/UDP performance differences

Test Scenarios
    - 1. Basic TCP Test
        - Goal: Measure bandwidth and connection reliability over TCP.
        - Start Server on Laptop:
            - iperf3 -s
        - Run Client on Phone:
            - iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10
        - Sample Output:
            - [  5]   0.00-10.00 sec  115 MBytes  96.5 Mbits/sec   sender
            - [  5]   0.00-10.00 sec  115 MBytes  96.5 Mbits/sec   receiver
        - Analysis:
            - 96.5 Mbits/sec → Effective bandwidth
            - Sender and receiver values should match
            - If sender > receiver, there may be packet loss

    - 2. UDP Test with Bandwidth and Jitter
        - Goal: Measure packet loss and jitter using UDP.
        - Start UDP Server:
            - iperf3 -s -u
        - Run UDP Client:
            - iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10 -u -b 10M
        - Sample Output:
            - [  5] 0.00-10.00 sec 12.0 MBytes  10.1 Mbits/sec  0.500 ms  0/10000 (0%)
        - Analysis:
            - 10.1 Mbits/sec → Achieved bandwidth
            - 0.500 ms → Jitter (delay variation)
            - 0/10000 (0%) → No packet loss
        - Please refer to image: iperf_udp_test.png

    - 3. Bidirectional Test
        - Goal: Measure both upload and download simultaneously.
        - Command:
            - iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10 --bidir
        - Sample Output:
            - [  5]  0.00-10.00 sec  50.0 MBytes  42.0 Mbits/sec sender
            - [  5]  0.00-10.00 sec  45.0 MBytes  38.0 Mbits/sec receiver
        - Analysis:
            - Tests both upstream and downstream
            - Look for symmetric or asymmetric results
        - Please refer to image: iperf_bidirectional_test.png

    - 4. Reverse Test
        - Goal: Measure download speed from server to client.
        - Command:
            - iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10 -R
        - Sample Output:
            - [  5]  0.00-10.00 sec  100 MBytes  85.0 Mbits/sec
        - Analysis:
            - If download speed is lower than upload → Network or ISP issue
        - Please refer to image: iperf_reverse_test.png

    - 5. Parallel Test
        - Goal: Test network handling of multiple connections.
        - Command:
            - iperf3 -c 192.168.1.10 -P 4
        - Sample Output:
            - [SUM] 0.00-10.00 sec  400 MBytes  320 Mbits/sec
        - Analysis:
            - Total bandwidth increases with parallel streams
            - If limited, network bottleneck may exist
        - Please refer to image: iperf_parallel_test.png

    - 6. Multicast Test
        - Goal: Test multicast support on the network.
        - Start Multicast Server:
            - iperf3 -s -u -B 239.255.0.1
        - Join Multicast Group:
            - iperf3 -c 239.255.0.1 -u
        - Analysis:
            - Ensure multicast packets are delivered
            - Packet loss or low bandwidth → Multicast not supported

Metrics to Analyze
    - Metric: Bandwidth
        - Meaning: Rate of data transmission
        - Good Value: High value
    - Metric: Packet Loss
        - Meaning: Percentage of lost packets
        - Good Value: Near 0%
    - Metric: Jitter
        - Meaning: Variation in packet arrival time
        - Good Value: < 5 ms
    - Metric: Latency
        - Meaning: Delay in data transmission
        - Good Value: < 50 ms
    - Metric: TCP Retransmissions
        - Meaning: Number of packets resent
        - Good Value: Near 0

Troubleshooting Tips
    - Check firewall settings if iPerf doesn't work.
    - Ensure both devices are in the same subnet.
    - Disable client isolation or MAC filtering if you face issues.
    - If speeds are low, check router bandwidth limits or interference.

Conclusion
- iPerf is a powerful tool for diagnosing network issues, measuring bandwidth, and analyzing jitter and packet loss.
- Through testing with different protocols, directions, and parallel streams, you can optimize your network for better performance!
