Objective -> Divide the network into 4 subnets

What is subnetting?

	-Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). It allows for more efficient use of IP addresses, improved network security, and better network organization.
	

We are given the IP address range : 192.168.1.0/24 and we need to subnet the same into 4 subnetworks

Steps to subnet :

	- Analysing the given IP

		- 192.168.1.0/24 belongs the Class C Range of IP Address with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0

		- The /24 in the IP tells us that there are 2^8 total address i.e, 256 total address

		- The valid range would be 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 (256 address including 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.255)

		- The first IP address is always set as the network address so 192.168.1.0 -> Network Address

		- The last IP address is always set as the broadcast address so 192.168.1.255 -> Broadcast Address

	- Dividing into subnets

		- We need to increase the subnet bits to create 4 subnets thus to create 4 subnets we need 2 additional bits

		- 2^2 = 4 bits thus new subnet mask would be /26 -> 255.255.255.192

	- Subnet Calculation

		Subnet			Network Address			First Usable IP			Last Usable IP			Braodcast Address

		1 				192.168.1.0/26			192.168.1.1 			192.168.1.62 			192.168.1.63
		
		2 				192.168.1.64/26			192.168.1.65 			192.168.1.126			192.168.1.127
		
		3				192.168.1.128/26		192.168.1.129			192.168.1.190			192.168.1.191
		
		4				192.168.1.192/26		192.168.1.193			192.168.1.254			192.168.1.255


Basic steps to calculate Subnetting:

	- Find the value x such that 2^x >= number of subnets reuqired

	- Calculate the new subnet mask 

	- find the increment by using

		 32 - last set octet value in subnet mask

	- Find the number of hosts using

		32 - new subnet value = y
		2^y - 2

	- Create the new subnets

Steps:

	- Open cisco packet tracer

	- Create a network with 4 devices each connected to a switch connected to a router (Ref to Setup Image)

	- Assign IP address to the same for example:

		Device	Subnet	IP Address	Subnet Mask	Gateway
		PC1	Subnet 1	192.168.1.10	255.255.255.192	192.168.1.1
		PC2	Subnet 2	192.168.1.70	255.255.255.192	192.168.1.65
		PC3	Subnet 3	192.168.1.130	255.255.255.192	192.168.1.129
		PC4	Subnet 4	192.168.1.200	255.255.255.192	192.168.1.193

	- Connect devices using the switch 

	- Configure the static IP routes on the router 

		Router1:

			enable
			configure terminal
			interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
			ip address 192.168.1.62 255.255.255.192
			no shutdown
			exit
			interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
			ip address 192.168.1.190 255.255.255.192
			no shutdown
			exit
			interface gigabitEthernet 0/2
			ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
			no shutdown
			exit
			ip route 192.168.1.64 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.2
			ip route 192.168.1.192 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.2
			end
			copy running-config startup-config
			show interfaces brief
			show ip interface brief
			show ip route

		Router2:
		
			enable
			configure terminal
			interface gigabitEthernet 0/2
			ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.252
			no shutdown
			exit
			interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
			ip address 192.168.1.126 255.255.255.192
			no shutdown
			exit
			interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
			ip address 192.168.1.254 255.255.255.192
			no shutdown
			exit
			ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.1
			ip route 192.168.1.128 255.255.255.192 10.0.0.1
			end
			copy running-config startup-config
			show interfaces brief
			show ip interface brief
			show ip route

	- Use ping to verify the connection 

Common Problems faced:

	- PC cannot ping its gateway -> Incorrect gateway IP on PC -> Verify and correct gateway IP on PC.
	- PC cannot ping a PC in a different subnet -> Missing static route on router -> Add static route on router to destination network.
	- Router interface is down -> Cable unplugged or faulty -> Check cable connection and replace if needed.
	- Ping fails intermittently -> IP address conflict -> Assign unique IP addresses to devices.

Conclusion:

	Thus by understanding how to subnet a network one can efficiently configure any real world network and ensure better connectivity
