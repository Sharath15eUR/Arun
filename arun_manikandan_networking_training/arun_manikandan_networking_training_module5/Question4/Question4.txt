What is DHCP?


* DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol that automatically assigns an IP address and other network config parameters to devices when connected to a network.
* Without DHCP we will have to manually assign the IP address


Why DHCP?


* Automation -> Eliminates the need for manual IP assigning
* Resource Management -> Efficiently allocates limited IP addresses
* Centralization -> Provides a single Point of Control for network config
* Error Reduction -> Prevents IP conflicts


How DHCP Works?


* DHCP mainly functions through the DORA Process


1. Discover
        * Client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER message with destination 255.255.255.255
        * Client has no IP address yet so source is 0.0.0.0
        * Message contains the client’s MAC Address and optional requested IP
        * Broadcast reaches all devices on the local network


2. Offer
        * DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER message
        * Offer includes an available IP address and lease duration
        * Contains the subnet mask , default gateway and other configs
        * Multiple servers can respond with different offers
        * Offers are typically unicast directly to the client’s MAC address


3. Request
        * Client selects one offer and broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST
        * This allows other DHCP servers to know their offers aren’t selected
        * Request includes the server id of the chosen server
        * Request confirms the IP address that the client wants to lease


4. Acknowledgement
        * Selected Server sends a DHCPACK message
        * Confirms the IP address assignment and provides final config parameters
        * Client now configures its network interface with the provided information


Steps to observe the DORA Process


* Open up wireshark and selected the network interface we intend to monitor 
        
        Example: eth0 or ens33

* Run the following command to call for the DORA process
        
        ipconfig /release
        ipconfig /renew

* The above 2 commands ensures that the IP address is cleared and a new one is requested from the server

* Now in wireshark apply the filter “bootp || dhcp” to capture the DORA Packets

* Now we have the DORA packets 




Analyzing the DORA Packets


1. DISCOVER
  

        * From the above packet the following are understood
                        
                - Source IP: 0.0.0.0 (client has no IP yet)
                - Destination IP: 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)
                - UDP ports: Source 68, Destination 67
                - Contains client's MAC address
                - DHCP Message Type: 1 (DISCOVER)
                - May contain Parameter Request List (options client wants)


        * The client creates a DHCPDISCOVER packet and broadcasts the same to all devices in the network


2. OFFER
        * To the request made the DHCP Server responds:

                - Source IP: 192.168.0.1 (DHCP server)
                - Destination IP: 255.255.255.255 (often broadcast) or direct to MAC
                - UDP ports: Source 67, Destination 68
                - DHCP Message Type: 2 (OFFER)
                - Your (client) IP address: 192.168.0.150 (example)
                - Server identifier: 192.168.0.1
                - Lease time: 600 seconds
                - Additional parameters: subnet mask, router, DNS, etc.


        * The DHCP Server receive the DISCOVER Packet
        * Checks address pool for available IP
        * Reserves the IP temporarily
        * Creates OFFER message with configs
        * Sends the Response to client


3. REQUEST
        * Client confirms that it wants the offered IP address

                - Source IP: 0.0.0.0 (still no configured IP)
                - Destination IP: 255.255.255.255 (broadcast)
                - UDP ports: Source 68, Destination 67
                - DHCP Message Type: 3 (REQUEST)
                - Requested IP Address: 192.168.0.150
                - Server Identifier: 192.168.0.1 (identifies chosen server)
                - Parameter Request List: configuration options client wants


        * Client selects the best offer received
        * Creates REQUEST packet with server ID and requested IP
        * Broadcasts Request with server ID and requested IP
        * Broadcasts REQUEST to inform all the servers
        * Other servers withdraw their offers


4. ACK
        * Server confirms the assignment

                - Source IP: 192.168.0.1 (DHCP server)
                - Destination: Client MAC or broadcast
                - UDP ports: Source 67, Destination 68
                - DHCP Message Type: 5 (ACK)
                - Your (client) IP address: 192.168.0.150
                - Lease time: 600 seconds
                - Renewal time (T1): 300 seconds
                - Rebinding time (T2): 525 seconds
                - All requested configuration parameters

        * The server commits the lease to its database
        * Sends a ACK with final parameters
        * Client receives the ACK and configs the network interface
        * Client may perform ARP to check for IP conflicts
        * Client begins to use the assigned IP address


Problems that can be faced

* IP address exhaustion -> IP pool is too small -> Expand the DHCP Scope
* IP address conflict -> Duplicate IP or multiple DHCP servers -> Remove conflicts
* DHCP Server not responding -> Server down / firewall block -> Start service and allow all ports


Conclusion

* DHCP being important for IP allocation at enterprise level needs to be configured and understood inorder to properly configure DHCP and timely troubleshoot to ensure smooth network operation.
