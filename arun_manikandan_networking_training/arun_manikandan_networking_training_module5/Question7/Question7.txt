Objective → Network Address Translation (NAT) Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer

What is NAT (Network Address Translation):

	- NAT allows a private network to connect to external public networks (like the internet) using a single public IP address.
	- It translates private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x) to a public IP address, enabling internet access for devices on the private network.
	- NAT is essential because IPv4 addresses are limited and private IP addresses cannot directly access public networks.

How NAT Works:

	- Private to Public Translation:

		- Devices in a private network use private IP addresses (192.168.x.x) for internal communication.

		- When a device wants to access the internet, the NAT router replaces the source IP (private IP) with a public IP.

	- Maintaining Connection:

		- NAT creates a translation table to remember the internal-private to external-public mapping.

		- When the external server responds, NAT reverses the process — replacing the public IP with the original private IP.

Types of NAT:

	- Static NAT – One-to-one mapping between private and public IP.

	- Dynamic NAT – Maps private IPs to a pool of public IPs.

	- PAT (Port Address Translation) – Maps multiple private IPs to a single public IP using different port numbers.

Example:

	Private IP: 192.168.1.10
	Public IP (assigned to router): 200.200.200.1

	When 192.168.1.10 sends a ping to 8.8.8.8, NAT translates the packet like:
	192.168.1.10 → 200.200.200.1 → 8.8.8.8
	When the reply comes back:
	8.8.8.8 → 200.200.200.1 → 192.168.1.10

	
Steps to Configure NAT:

	1. Setup the Network:
		
		- Create a network with 2 PCs connected to a switch.
		
		- Connect the switch to Router0 using a FastEthernet interface.
		
		- Connect Router0 to Router1 using a Gigabit interface.
		
		- Set up Router1 to simulate internet connectivity using a loopback interface.

	2. Assign IP Addresses:

		PC0:
		IP: 192.168.1.10
		Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
		Gateway: 192.168.1.1
		
		PC1:
		IP: 192.168.1.11
		Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
		Gateway: 192.168.1.1
		
		Router0:
		Gigabit0/0 → 192.168.1.1
		Gigabit0/1 → 200.200.200.1 (Public IP)
		
		Router1:
		Gigabit0/0 → 200.200.200.2
		Loopback0 → 8.8.8.8
	
	3. Configure NAT on Router0:
	
		- Define the private network:

			Router0(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
		
		- Set up NAT to translate private IPs to the public IP:
		
			Router0(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 interface Gigabit0/1 overload
		
		- Mark internal and external interfaces:
		
			Router0(config)# interface Gigabit0/0
			Router0(config-if)# ip nat inside
			Router0(config-if)# exit

			Router0(config)# interface Gigabit0/1
			Router0(config-if)# ip nat outside
			Router0(config-if)# exit
	
	4. Configure Router1 to Simulate Internet:

		- Create a loopback interface:
		
			Router1(config)# interface loopback0
			Router1(config-if)# ip address 8.8.8.8 255.255.255.255
			Router1(config-if)# no shutdown

		- Set up a route to simulate internet connectivity:
		
			Router1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 loopback0

	5. Test NAT Configuration:
		From PC0:
	
		ping 8.8.8.8
		From Router0:
	
		Check NAT translations:

			show ip nat translations

Issues That Can Be Faced:

	- Ping Fails:

		- NAT misconfigured — Check if ip nat inside and ip nat outside are set correctly.

		- Incorrect ACL — Ensure that the access list permits internal addresses.

		- Loopback on Router1 is down — Ensure that the loopback interface is active (no shutdown).

	- No NAT Translations Visible:

		- NAT might not be set up on the correct interfaces — Verify ip nat inside and ip nat outside.

	- One-Way Communication:

		- No static route on Router1 — Ensure the default route (0.0.0.0) is pointing to the loopback.

Behavior After Successful NAT:
	- PC's private IP (192.168.1.10) is translated to public IP (200.200.200.1) before leaving Router0.
	- Router1 receives packets with source IP as 200.200.200.1 and sends a reply.
	- NAT table on Router0 tracks the mapping and translates the packet back to 192.168.1.10 when the response comes.

Why NAT is Used in Real-World Networks:

	- Preserves IPv4 addresses due to shortage of public IPs.
	- Allows internal networks to communicate with external networks securely.
	- NAT adds a layer of security by hiding internal IPs from the external network.


Conclusion:

	- NAT allows private networks to access the internet using a single public IP address.
	- This setup demonstrated how to configure and test NAT in a Cisco Packet Tracer simulation.
	- Troubleshooting included misconfigured interfaces, incorrect ACLs, and missing routes.
