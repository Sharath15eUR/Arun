Objective -> Manually Configure Static IP on Devices

What is static IP address?

	- A static IP is a fixed IP address that is set manually to a device and doesnt change unless manually modified

	- Once configured, the device retains the same IP address even after rebooting

	- Commonly used for devices that require consistent network identity some of which include:

		- Servers
		- Network Printers
		- Remote access
		- IoT devices

Difference between Static and Dynamic IP

	- Static IP is manually assigned whereas a dynamic IP is assigned by DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

	- Static IP remains the same untill changed whereas Dynamic IP can change over time

	- Static IP are more vulnerable to attack where as Dynamic IP is not due to less exposure caused by regular IP change

Why static IP?

	- It is consistent and Reliable

	- Ensures Remote Access

	- Port forwarding and NAT (Network Address Translation)

	- DNS and Hosting

	- Reduced Network conflicts


Steps to configure static IP in Linux

	- First ensure that the system is up to date and install net-tools:

		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install net-tools

	- The above step is important in order to use the ifconfig command which comes bundled in teh net-tools package

	- Now check the current network interface using the ifconfig command just type ifconfig and hit enter

	- Example output

	- In the above it could be understood that ens33 is the Network interface name inet->Current IP address netmask -> Subnet mask broadcast -> Broadcast address

	- To assign static IP to any interface using the following template

		sudo ifconfig <interface_name> <ip_address> netmask <subnetmask> up

		Example:

		sudo ifconfig enp0s3 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

	- Now once the static ip is assigned we have to change/set the default gateway to do so use :

		sudo route add default gw <gateway_ip> <interface_name>

		Example:

		sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1 enp0s3

	- Optionally configure the DNS by editing /etc/resolv.conf file by adding 

		nameserver 8.8.8.8
		nameserver 8.8.4.4

	- The above ensures that we use Google DNS for resolving although it is purely optional and not necessary

	- Verify changes by running the ifconfig command again

		ifconfig

	- Check the routing table to see if the gateway is changed and set by running

		route -n

	- Now we have successfully setup a static ip and is configured


Problems faced:

	- IP Conflict -> Two devices with same IP -> use arp -a to find the conflict

	- No internet -> Wrong gateway or dns -> Check routing by calling ip route

	- Changes lost after restart -> Not made persistent -> add to persistent config file

	- If ifconfig is deprecated then use the ip addr command 
Common Best Practices

	- Assign IP outside the DHCP range

	- Keep Record of assigned static IP

	- Use Secure DNS 

	- Test connectivity after assigning Static IP

Conclusion

	- Configuring static IP ensures a stable and reliable connection, mainly for servers and other critical devices.

	- Using the ifconfig we have the complete control over the network interfaces thus capable of improving consistency and connectivty
